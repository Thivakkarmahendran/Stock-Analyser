IMO, this will only end if China steps up and helps NATO or Putin is removed from power from within.

Russia already knows of the implications. They quite frankly don't care at this point because they know they have been getting away with it for quite some time.

It's going to get REAL ugly. Markets are probably not going to recover for another year or two. With inflation, supply chain issues, and now this, there's no easy way to relieve any of it.",55,2022-02-24 04:25:03

A:) the market was at a natural area of support it had pulled back to the January lows, it was always going to bounce here, now time will tell if it’s sustained or not.  

The flight to safety—- already covered. 

If you look historically mid-term years are generally weaker for the first 2/3 months but generally recover strong through mid year a dip in early fall but finish strong.  

Once the market opened ( $SPY) and never retested the premarket low ($410) then it was a good sign buyers were going to show up & push things higher. 

We still have a ways to go in order to regain the bullish levels- but this is a positive step. Plus many of the big money positions closed out their shorts from the top— doesn’t mean that they don’t reposition soon though. So tread carefully 

In this environment daytrading multiple contracts & taking profits quickly is the path to success. 

Larger accounts with longer timeframes can start buying many of their favorite stocks that are profitable. 

Another thing to consider, the market was pricing in a .50 rate hike or higher— but with the current conflict there’s a good chance that it will be lower, certainly not higher—- markets hate uncertainty.",2,2022-02-25 00:50:45

What we saw today was essentially volatility and an over correction from the drop in the morning. Over time, price oscillates above/below the mean but always tries to move back to the mean. This morning, QQQ deviated hard from the mean but then over corrected. One of the reasons for this is because from a technical perspective, the market was over sold.

stocks,Russia will lose their European LNG market share,syopu2,"Pffff…. They said that when Russia responded to Georgia’s aggression by invading it and annexing South Ossetia and Abkhazia in 2008. They said that when Putin docked half the black sea fleet off Syria’s coast to thwart NATO’s attempt at full scale invasion in 2013. They said that when he annexed Crimea later that year. They said that when he continuously helped prop up Assad through Assad’s victory in the civil war. He does not care about stupid sanctions and knows Europe needs their energy.

Putin has been cucking the west for 15 years at least. A large reason for his success has been NATO’s repeated stupidity since 2000: driving up global energy prices with Bush that allowed Russia to reform from a debt ridden society to a surplus nation able to arm itself again; fostering a coup in Georgia in 03 and then convincing the Georgians to try and occupy parts of North Ossetia in 08; funding losing insurrectionists in the Syrian Civil War while Assad, now more entrenched than ever, became more dependent/loyal to Russia; failing to make a deal with Iran and therefore allowing that major OPEC chip to be a cog in the Russia/China framework and not NATO, thus losing market share control (same with Venezuela); funding insurrectionist in the Ukraine since 2014 without an actual plan to hold or take Crimea even though it was obvious the Russians would annex it immediately because of the value of Sevastopol. 

And now this. Putin is a formidable opponent but he’s going against arrogant amateurs and thus keeps taking pounds of flesh (South Ossetia, Abkhazia, Crimea, Eastern Ukraine, etc.) Who’s next? 

And importantly, since the United States splooged $20 trillion losing a war against Afghan goat herders and Iraqi cab drivers, accomplishing nothing, Putin knows that our military is just spent and has no desire for another, more real, fight. 

They will one day look back at the period of 2000 to 2025 and wonder how they fucked it so bad. Maybe should’ve built some infrastructure or reformed societal systems.

stocks,Russia will lose their European LNG market share,syopu2,"Ukraine is almost completely dependent on the Russian pipeline and owe Russia vast sums of money. The Germans subsidize Ukraine with an accounting trick called ""back flow"" which is really just them allowing Ukraine to siphon off gas for themselves. Although the Americans are willing to fight to the last Ukrainian to hem Russia in with sanctions and get Nordstream2 cancelled, Ukraine, which is teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, knows it cannot afford to stand up to Russia if they want to keep the lights on, literally. Ukraine might be going to the IMF for money but that won't give them gas automatically. Just more debt. 

In the end, the Germans and others want Nordstream2 and just have to find a way to push the US back from stopping it. If the gas taps stop from Ukraine and NS2 then Europe will go pretty dark. Also, French Total has some big project with Russia that Macron doesn't want to see shelved.

Not going to happen, Russia has some of the largest oil and natural gas reserves and it's merely a pipeline to countries like Germany.

The cost to compress and ship natural gas compared a pipeline from Russia would be massive, not to mention you still need facilities to store, transport and process the NG.

In the US, people squawk about the rising price, often a few cents for natural gas along with electricity with special carve outs for those of a low-income nature.  Think about the crying that will happen when Germans and French start freezing in the winter, or can't run their AC during a heat wave (how many died in France a few years back?) because of rationing of electricity?

""Priced in"" assumes the market is rational. It also assumes nothing changes. The FED may also need to do something ""unhinged"" if inflation expectations remain high or worsen despite tightening.

> Economic data is strong. Consumer spending, GDP growth, unemployment numbers, etc. Periods of high inflation aren’t necessarily indicative of economic issues. GDP contraction and unemployment are much better indicators.

High inflation is fine for the markets. The risk is with inflation comes rate hikes and that we may be entering an inflationary spiral which the FED will need to induce a recession to fix it. It's probably unlikely, but we just don't know for sure how this will play out yet. There are clearly a lot of extremely smart people worried about the situation we find ourselves in right now.

> Russia/Ukraine is a temporary situation. WW3 is not going to happen. I’m not staying that Russia isn’t going to invade, but it doesn’t pose any long term risks to the US economy.

Putin is becoming increasingly unhinged and it wouldn't be that hard to imagine what happened yesterday being looked back on by future generations as the catalyst for a much more serious conflict. At some point Russia is going to go to far and things will need to escalate to war, even if it is a proxy war with the West. Another thing I worry about is that the sanctions cause Putin to lose the support of his people. I worry that Putin is the kind of guy who would rather risk starting a world war in an attempt to rally the country behind him than to step down peacefully.

But to your point, I don't think further escalation is an immediate risk to markets. I do worry over the next decade we're likely to see more serious geo political risks like this play out. If markets are nervous about Russia and Ukraine, imagine how the market is going to react when China tries to take Taiwan.

> Supply chain issues will ease, as many companies have guided this, and as someone who works in logistics I can tell you that the disruptions are easing.

Sure, but I think the main risk here is that we see a wage-price spiral that persists after the supply chain issues ease.

> Covid is dying down and is exiting the pandemic phase. This is very overlooked for some reason.

GDP and unemployment are not real-time indicators. Not that I think they are problematic right now, but the stock market is a leading indicator, and we're going to see economy-wide issues show up in stock prices before they show up in GDP and unemployment.

I also think it's way too early to decide that the Ukraine issue is contained in any sense.

Russia invading Ukraine (4.) will send oil and energy prices skyrocketing, feeding further inflation (3.). I’m not so sure inflation is peaking either, and even if it does peak it may still hang around uncomfortable levels.

Some supply chain issues (5.) are easing, but not all — and we haven’t seen all of it yet. Omicron is yet to hit China properly. If/when it does, expect more factories and ports closed. The world economy has piggybacked largely on China’s zero Covid policy. If China fails, 30% of global supply is endangered.

Covid (6.) isn’t necessarily ”dying down”. Omicron (BA1) wave is slowing down for sure, although a BA2 wave seems to be emerging. We might be good for a while, but come autumn and winter, I wouldn’t be surprised to see another round of variants. I haven’t seen many experts too optimistic about the pandemic ending. The catch is that we largely avoided a Covid-caused economic crash due to central bank intervention (QE).

3. Inflation, is still running away, the fed should've done their first hike last month, but instead decided against it for god knows what reason. So inflation is still increasing.

4. Russia holds a ton of precious metals needed for semiconductors, semiconductors are needed for supply chain to a certain degree. To add, oil will become another problem.

stocks,Why I’m bullish,sz34c2,"Interesting, heres my take on your take:  
1) There's no way reliable way of knowing if rates are priced in. Just conjecture. Wont know until they hit it with a hammer (raise rates) and see what happens. They don't know either, or they would be able to accurately predict CPI (they don't understand the unprecedented dynamics)  
2) Economic data being strong only validates the Feds decisions to be more aggressive, not the other way around, if economic data was weak they would continue printing.  
3) This is an assumption, the conditions are far more dynamic than in the 70s or 80s. We simply don't understand the shock to the system covid lockdowns caused, the intial transient effects are just know being felt. You may be right, but until numbers reflect what you're saying, hedge funds/investment banks will more than likely consider the situation uncertain.  
4) Agree here  
5) Another assumption, the reality is the supply chain issues is related to multiple factors which are dynamic due to unprecedented lifestyle changes (people moving from cities to suburbs) and other covid lockdown related factors. You may be right, but its not obvious these issues will be fixe and until metrics prove otherwise uncertainty prevails.  
   
6) Imo civil unrest will replace covid drama, this is the biggest threat to the declining US economy/nation-state, and it appears to be accelerating.

stocks,Why I’m bullish,sz34c2,"Completely agree, if you can hold your nose and stomach the volatility the next few months are a buying opportunity. Ultimately, the path forward for the market all comes down to inflation and monetary policy. 

My thoughts are that we are at/near peak inflation due to the following:  
i) Removal of base effect lowers magnitude of inflation prints (this affects sentiment / psychology of the consumer)  
ii) Supply chains will inevitably improve as global economy normalizes; there have already been several signs of easing  
iii) The consumer gorged on durable goods won't be repeated & companies have built inventories after being caught flat footed coming out of 2020  
iv) The switch to services by the consumer this spring / summer will be massive (huge vacation boom, long BA)  
v) The effects of stimulus is wearing off, saving rate continues to trend down; this will drive people back into the labour force (participation increase last jobs report)  
vi) JPOW will do his best not to invert the yield curve while fighting inflation, once midterms over I wouldn't be surprised to see a more dovish Fed  
vii) 10 yr clearly shows investors don't believe high inflation is structural  
viii) Global growth is showing signs of slowing  
ix) China who exited the pandemic before the West is easing (I understand there are some idiosyncratic issues here but China also plays a huge role in the global economy)  
x) Lastly, we have seen a ton of aberrant data from the pandemic (see negative oil ), strange things have happened and I believe this huge blip in inflation at least partially falls in the same category.",1,2022-02-23 01:52:19

stocks,Why I’m bullish,sz34c2,"1) 3-6 hikes are priced in.  Market is uncertain about magnitude of interest rate change.  The spread is so wide you could drive a mack truck through it.  Huge room for disappointment and corresponding decline.

2) GDP is rolling.  Mortgages are rolling. Unemployment is manipulated (see labor force participation).  Ex stimulus GDP is going lower. 

3) Inflation will be resilient.  People underestimate the ripple effect of one supply chains effect on another.  This will not be fixed for years.  Energy is the root commodity for all commodities.  Its high price and persistence of demand and lack of supply growth ensure massive inflation in fertilizer and food, steel and autos.  inflation is transitory on a long enough time frame.  Hopefully you will be alive to see it recede. 

4.) Russia and Ukraine highlights the West decline and lack of ability to deal with problems. The west is more concerned with equality and perception rather then meritocracy and reality. Putin is showing just how poor our western leader are, and how ill equipped they are to deal with strong capable foes.  cmon would you draft Biden or Putin to be your fantasy geopolitics leader.

5. Supply chain issue will ease over a 6 to 12 month timeline, but this has massive ripple effects. 

6 Covid will go away or recede, but the policies and precedents have all but ruined freedom and confidence in our governments and institutions. 

The market will once again price of tangible earnings.  When a company produces consistent results ( re cash flow and earnings) you will see the outcome in its stock price.  Potential will be wrung out of market multiples and it will take years for this to happen.  Imagine darlings like ROKU, RBLX, NFLX, PLTR, and even high fliers like AMZN  trading down to 50-75% over next five years.  A market should never reward potential with 1000x multiples because just as owners of Minecraft and Fortnight found out: a Roblox is right around the corner always.

stocks,Why I’m bullish,sz34c2,"1. Sure. Why not.
2. Consumer spending is about to adjust to the new reality, which is there is mostly the same amount of money to spend, and everything costs a lot more. Which should mean that consumers have less purchasing power. If they are buying the same things, they will necessarily have to stop buying as many or as much as they have. Otherwise there debt load is rising fast. GDP is a measure of productivity but it doesn't say where the compensation for this productivity goes. I'll let you guess. Unemployment. Please, people still need food, rent, medicine, electricity, and transportation. There is no more stimulus money, reserves dwindling to non-existent, and credit limits are being reached.
3. Inflation is not peaking, its plateauing. When profits are up and prices are up, that's a good indication that companies are being opportunistic during these volatile times.
4. Russia, like always is a nuisance and a distraction from domestic issues. The beginning of the end of Russian/OPEC wars began with the US push for energy independence after the oil crisis of the 1970s. The US's imports of foreign oil fell to 36 percent in 2013 (during the Barack Obama administration), down from a high of 60 percent in 2006 (during the George W. Bush administration). So the real war is being and has been fought economically through technology and domestic policy.
5. Supply chain issues will definitely ease. I've started getting my orders from a year ago. But there are still bare shelves at the grocery stores. Soon what's offered will change as people's buying habits change due to economic necessity.
6. COVID dying down is not overlooked. Its beyond priced in as to not even be relevant. Omnicrom was the last biological push into endemic status. It will, as predicted from the beginning, become a persistent, seasonal respiratory disease. Vaccines, treatments, and milder strains will bring this to the point of normalcy and acceptance. People are way past the point of caring and have been. Business as usual.

I'm not saying you are necessarily wrong on all of your points, but you are taking uncertainties and acting certain that none of them are an issue, when maybe some of them are... uncertain.

stocks,Why I’m bullish,sz34c2,"Not sure this idea of inflation being priced in is truly valid. The potential for them has been priced in, that's a good chunk of the impact but the fullness of the impact will continue to be felt until after the fact. Inflation is supposed to peak at 14% and then settle below 4% at the end of the year according to the FED's own predictions. So it hasn't peaked yet. Also, how inflation responds to those changes will also have an effect. My bet is that the rate changes will be far too small and inflation will persist in getting worse. The FED is trying not to scare people but I double we can get inflation under 4% that easily. I don't think the market has even fully priced in the how badly damaged our supply chain is, and the Russia/Ukraine conflict is going to make the supply chain situation go from bad to worse. And it doesn't have to last long to tip the balance. Not to mention that for long term investing the inflation problems are going to get worse. We've got huge spending problems and the inflation on our debt is compounding the issue. Low supply and high inflation also don't play well together.

Economic data is strong. I believe much of the economic data we have seen in the last 10 years is propaganda. Inflation is being misrepresented lower. Unemployment is being misrepresented lower. etc. At some point all this hot air is going to cause problems and a big part of those problems is going to be not seeing the problems coming. 

~~Covid is dying down and is exiting the pandemic phase. This is very overlooked for some reason.~~ Covid numbers are not down. It's spiking every 4-6 months and the most recent spike was much bigger than those before (the three previous spikes 7 day average peaked around 1 million new cases and Jan's spike was closing in on 4 million at 3.7 million new cases). With it getting so much worse on that last spike I'd be very surprized if 3-5 months from now we didn't another big spike in cases peaking at at least 1 million new cases on the 7 day average, if not more.",1,2022-02-23 05:27:47

However, remember that companies come and go. Ideas change, human behavior changes, innovation happens and the world can look very different very fast. Think Sears, GE, IBM, Exxon, AT&T, Intel, Cisco, GM, NTT, HP, etc. in their heyday no one ever thought that they would give up their leadership position as the top companies by market cap. However, companies come and go, boom and bust, new market leaders emerge when new generations step in. No investment is ever certain and it’s never guaranteed that a market leader today will be a market leader in 10-20 years. That’s why people always recommend the S&P500 to capture companies that eventually will rise to the top.

It’s possible that people will use the internet in completely different ways than we can currently imagine and conceive in today’s world. Who knows, we may get to a point where people don’t even type on a phone or a keyboard to search information. We may get to a point where people don’t use 2d, flat surface monitors or phones in the future. Search engines could look completely different in the future. Will Google spearhead a change? Maybe and maybe not.

Bing feels more like you are visiting a website like Yahoo than using a search engine.

stocks,What are the chances that a new search engine or platform can take away significant market share from Google in the next 5-10 years?,swhuo7,"In short, no. At least nothing that anyone here could reasonably predict with any certainty.

Google has and will continue to have an unbeatably large moat in search. The longer it’s on top, the larger that lead gets through AI and Machine Learning. Not to mention the insights and headstart it would have on any competitor. The hardware risk that FB has (its app has to be on Apple or android phones) doesn’t exist for Google as they own android and pay Apple an ungodly amount of money to be the standard search function on iPhone. Apple and Amazon have tried to take down search and failed, and likely don’t see a reason to try again. Amazon is making its own ad business through the Amazon app, but that’s not a replacement for true search.

Something truly seismic would have to happen that would get the world away from searching on the internet, which no one here can really predict. Far fetched ideas like Nueralink or Facebook smart glasses where people start to interact through the world differently could change the idea of typing into a smartphone, but even then Google won’t sit idly by and let it happen.

stocks,What are the chances that a new search engine or platform can take away significant market share from Google in the next 5-10 years?,swhuo7,"I don't think it's very likely. On the other hand, Google's search has changed over the last decade:

1. they have become very good at ""answering questions"". Try a query like ""how tall is Pelosi"" or ""how old is the pantheon"". This was largely a growth from the purchase of metaweb, and might be hard to replicated.
2. search results have gotten generally worse, with a lot of google crap crowding out legitimate non-google results. Try a query like \[reviews of LA story\] and a lot of the screen real estate is dedicated to selling you access to this old movie. This is essentially irrelevant to the query, but boosts their bottom line at the expense of search quality. duckduckgo gives a much cleaner result.
3. take a query like 'future of space travel' and what you see is essentially marketing material for spacex. The query \[future of cooking\] has only one result showing on my page, with misdirections to what they think are related queries.  By contrast, add the word ""wikipedia"" and you'll see many related \*results\*. Google believes too much in their curated nonsense, and too little in actual web results. Another query where this fails is \[repair leather furniture\]

Sridhar Ramaswamy and Vivek Raghunathan started the Neeva competitor to Google, but it's based on a strange model, namely subscriptions rather than ads. This may intersect with Google's future plans, because I have predicted for 5 years that Google would eventually require you to login before you could do a query. If that happens, it will cause a lot of people to start looking for an alternative. This kind of disruption is consistent with Google's insatiable desire for data, which they believe can improve the personalization of search results - but far more importantly - they believe will improve the effectiveness of advertising.

Your original question was ""can someone take market share in the next 5 years"" and I think the answer is no. That company would have to already be crawling, and I don't see any serious competitors in the logs that I have access to. Neeva is crawling at about half the rate of Google. Bing is competitive. Petalsearch is flying under the radar right now. Apple is crawling a fair amount, but their Siri product is kind of pathetic and they appear to have no headway toward building a search engine.

Keep in mind that Google doesn't make money from search - they make it from ads. The advertising business is pretty big, but nobody has much headway on taking the search part of advertising right now, and that is the highest margin part of advertising.

It would take an innovation to capture imagination of users. Maybe a checkbox to only include results without ads on them, or the ability to block sites from your search results (bye bye w3schools), or some other cool feature. I don't see it coming any time soon.",2,2022-02-20 06:45:49

Given how central powerhubs the search engine is, in Europe for example there have been efforts to create government funded alternatives. But usually they fail, because a) the average person doesn't care about socioeconomic power structures, only wants good search results, b) even european governments complained about the high costs involved, c) people keep using what they are used to, ... and probably a couple of other reasons I'm not thinking of.

Google as quasi-monopol search engine isn't going anywhere soon. (But off topic I do see Facebook/Instagram/Whats-app potentially loosing ground very fast, a social network has a bit utility of scale on the consumer side,  but it's comparable cheap to set up, a generation effect where children don't want to be in the same network as they parents, I see a competitor taking over comperabily quite likely).

Google has and will continue to have an unbeatably large moat in search. The longer it’s on top, the larger that lead gets through AI and Machine Learning. Not to mention the insights and headstart it would have on any competitor. The hardware risk that FB has (its app has to be on Apple or android phones) doesn’t exist for Google as they own android and pay Apple an ungodly amount of money to be the standard search function on iPhone. Apple and Amazon have tried to take down search and failed, and likely don’t see a reason to try again. Amazon is making its own ad business through the Amazon app, but that’s not a replacement for true search.

Something truly seismic would have to happen that would get the world away from searching on the internet, which no one here can really predict. Far fetched ideas like Nueralink or Facebook smart glasses where people start to interact through the world differently could change the idea of typing into a smartphone, but even then Google won’t sit idly by and let it happen.

* Advanced machine learning
* Name recognition
* Existing partnerships
* Cross-platform integration
* Cross-product integration
* Its own browser, extension store, etc.

A new search engine would have to both be more convenient *and* deliver better results.

The latter is practically impossible barring some niche subjects. The former is only possible if the newcomer gets backing from a nation, mainly by banning Google, Bing, etc. like China's Great Firewall. Nothing else would suffice.

As China's economy grows it becomes more and more important as a market, and the sheer numbers of eyeballs available in China make it very attractive.  In theory, if it starts to make financial sense to start advertising in the Chinese market more than the US/EU markets, then advertising with Chinese ad networks could threaten google's major revenue stream.

stocks,What are the chances that a new search engine or platform can take away significant market share from Google in the next 5-10 years?,swhuo7,"Great question. I think this is a fairly safe investment. 

Since most of the planet uses Google as their search engine already you have to ask yourself what it would take users to switch to something different. It will either be 1) competing company builds a 10x better search engine, 2) competing has superior ethics

1 is unlikely in 5-10 year timeframe.

2 is unlikely because Google has a long track record of having a stellar public image. It is good at managing customer perception of itself. The minute any company becomes a serious competitor, let’s say they’re more environmentally friendly, Google can use its piles of cash to become even greener - thereby the competitor will not have any leg to stand on. 

The future is unpredictable, but the chances of Google losing its dominance as a search engine are slim even in the next 50 years.

You’d need a web crawler. The search algorithm is practically trivial to beat since Google gives horrible results compared to 5-10 years ago. And then you’d need to advertise. If you throw hundreds of billions of $ at advertising you could conceivably get almost all users to switch. The problem with companies like Google or Facebook is all their users are free to go whenever and fads tend to sweep them out in one huge exodus. Another threat would be taking the service public and regulating it. If I Google some guy and you Google the same term you might get every scandalous article about him and I might get some alternate reality. That scenario is terrible for society.

stocks,Sold all stocks today,t0uoev,"Investing is about as easy as tying shoelaces.  The MOST important aspect is understanding the difference between INVESTING and GAMBLING.

One should not stop ""investing"".   The problem is understanding you have been GAMBLING and not investing.  Gambling is where you try to guess based on whatever metrics you want to use that you have found stocks that will do better then the market.  Just like with gambling a few do GREAT and most faii/ house wins.  Investing is taking what the market gives as a whole realizing over time the markets have to go up in a capitalistic economy (those who provide capital have to be rewarded or they will stop providing said capital).  


The problems are folks get their ""investing"" information from Reddit and other main stream sites from folks who don't know ANY of the data or evidency.  ALL the advice on here is so random and when pressed by folks, like me, to show some published data to support their claims there is only silence.    


If you want to know about investing it takes about 1 weekend of light reading. For those interested here are the quick books I recommend... 1.  Jack Bogle's ""Little book on common sense investing"" and 2.  Allen Roth's ""How a second grader beat wall street"".  Then do your self a favor and visit bogleheads website.

Now no one seems to know when they are gonna happen. At least if they know about ‘em, they’re not telling anybody about ‘em. I don’t remember anybody predicting the market right more than once, and they predict a lot. So they’re gonna happen. If you’re in the market, you have to know there’s going to be declines. And they’re going to cap and every couple of years you’re going to get a 10 percent correction. That’s a euphemism for losing a lot of money rapidly. That’s what a “correction” is called.

Market priced the stock as maybe 5% chance of success, arguably less.

stocks,Is the equity Bubble bursting?,sx4kt9,"I'm not sure there was a bubble. Prices have been fairly reasonable when you adjust for growth and interest rates. The problem is interest rates have been so low and now may need to raise so quickly it's quite possible this is just the start of a long, more severe bear market. If you just assume the 10y will be going to 1.5% then we would need the S&P500 to fall at least another 10%. And that's just 2.5%, were it to go to 3% you would be looking at 20-30%.

Then you have to consider slowing growth and recession risk. Not only will interest rate increases require multiple contraction, but they raise the chances of an economic slowdown and perhaps even a recession. In a worst case scenario where earnings contract a drop 50-60% drop on the S&P500 wouldn't be crazy.

And recession isn't the only risk here. Obviously we have the ongoing developments in Ukraine. While Russia invading Ukraine in itself probably wouldn't have much economic consequence there are lots of things that could happen in the way of supply-chain issues and sanctions that could hurt, especially within specific sectors of the economy.

What really bothers me is how this has all been playing out though... I've never seen specific segments of the market get hit so hard while other stocks like AAPL are doing fine. With AAPL near ATHs there is no way the NASDAQ can recover. You would have to assume almost every stock apart from AAPL is going to bounce back. I don't see that happening. The alternative is that AAPL demands an even higher multiple but I don't see that happening either. My guess is that the safety trade is next to be hit and that will play out next month. First low-quality growth was hit last year, then high quality growth towards the end of last year, then various low-conviction names like FB and NFLX started to get taken out and that just leaves the high quality stocks like AAPL. I personally I think AAPL should be trading closer to 22 PE and if I'm right you're looking at a 20-25% drop for AAPL and the S&P500 would likely follow.

I don't know what the bull case even is. During the COVID selloff my go to was that the FED would step in and that's what happened, but the FED can't step in now. In fact, they have no choice but to do exactly what the market doesn't want them to do and raise rates. In 2018 we saw far more severe drops in valuations and that was just from the FED reducing the balance sheet. This time they're likely to reduce the balance sheet and rapidly raise rates. And if the markets don't like it, they're not going to be able to do a U-turn like in 2018 unless financial conditions really deteriorate. And if that happens your stocks are likely to already be down 30%+.

I'm not sure what number I am. There was no bubble, but inflation not being transitory has now completely changed the game so we probably need to go quite a bit lower. If we don't see signs of inflation peaking soon, or if it actually gets worse, it's going to be brutal. At that point the FED will probably have no choice but to shock the economy into recession to combat inflation.

Some of the tech stocks are quite over-valued. But most are quite reasonable, and if they fall then maybe at most half of the market cap would evaporate, only to quickly gain it back.

As an investor, you just have to manage risks properly - not to get too much leverage, and expect things to fall to their true static value.

I think that it's just a normal environment, that's being destabilized by the following factors:

1. Uncertainty in supply chains due to politics and the pandemic
2. The abundance of ""noise traders"" which is a consequence of apps like RobinHood popping up everywhere and more news about investing than ever before.
3. (speculation) The recent rise of AI and ML-based market manipulators who disseminate even more noise to cause predictable instability to capitalize on. Before 2008, HFTs weren't a big thing, before 2014-ish behavioral economics wasn't as popular as it is today.

In my opinion, the best thing to do if you're not doing it as a full-time job, is to invest in value stocks of companies in new growing industries, or in not-so-overvalued growth stocks of companies who are taking over a big market and can justify the growth that's priced into the stock price.

* The tech bubble is largly deflated, but still a bit high.  Some of the bubble has shifted to non-tech and the overall market is still a bit high

* Worries of economic slowdown as we fight inflation could trigger another drop

So we're still in a partial bubble and with interest rates/QT could see some moderate price declines.  It's really the threat of economic slowdown/recession on top of that which could cause a big drop.

I'm guessing we go down another 5-10% if no recession and starting to recover towards the end of the year.  We go down 15-20% if we do get a slowdown leading to a recession.

I'm pretty new to investing. So still trying to find metrics to use, so see how things are going and if there is a chance of the market droping.  


I have found that there seems to be a corralation between labour shortage in construction and bigger corrections in the market.  


Like in 2q 1986 41% of companies in construction reported labour shortages. In june 1987 to september 1987 the S&P500 looked like it corrected from 329 to 230.  


In june (41%), july (46%), august (45%) and september (41%) 2006, companies in contruction also reported labour shortages as hampering them. In what juli 2008 to december 2008 S&P500 corrected from about 1500 to 750 points (by a glance at the graph on yahoo)  


August 2021 (43%), september 2021 (48%), october (47%), november 2021 (42%), december 2021(41%), january 2022 (41%) - S&P500....when?  


It seems like when over 40% of companies in construction report labour shortages as a problem for them, not long after the S&P500 take a bigger corrections/crashes. If that is a fluke I don't know, as i'm new, but I just find it funny.

My most likely scenario is treading water for another six months or so, and then back to price increases. Overlaid on that, a Ukraine invasion could cause another sharp drop with sharp recovery.

stocks,Is the equity Bubble bursting?,sx4kt9,"The cyclically-adjusted PE ratio historically ranges from 5 to 44. We are currently at 36. It might go up or down in the future, which is, of course, impossible to predict. But it seems we're still overvalued compared to the median value of 16. 

At some point in the future it may cross below the 16 mark, which means the S&P 500 will have to fall another 55% or so from where it sits now. And that would simply be a regression to a historical mean. If earnings drop and it causes the PE to drop to the previous low point, we're looking at a 90%+ drop.

If you can absorb further losses without having to sell other stocks, your car or your house, it really depends on whether you still believe in the company’s earnings prospects compared to the current stock price. Why did you buy that Tesla stock in the first place? Selling a stock solely because it has turned south should seldom make you want to sell unless the management is facing prison for fraud or something like that.

If the answer is ""yes"" - hold.

For me personally, the drop in TSLA has everything to do with the macro environment and nothing to do with the company. Tesla is still extremely profitable. Growing above 50% YoY. Still very much in the lead of a major major global tech revolution. So, IMHO, TSLA is a great investment. Even more so at the lower prices.

stocks,I bought TSLA in 2021 should I sell and take the L?,sxfvcy,"My take on TSLA… first and foremost, I honestly believe it’s not going anywhere and in 10 years it will remain a top 5 US company. All of this being said, I don’t know that it will stay Top 5 on the way there. Yeah I know… it’s not just a car company, it’s AI, solar, energy, robotaxis, robots, insurance, you name it. The fact remains that today it’s 95% a car company that sells only 2 real cars, plus a handful of S and X vehicles. All other aspects of their business are either pipe dreams, years away from solo profitability, or regulatory nightmares. The long game is probably quite strong for Tesla but the short game is tough. The way I look at it, it’s about a $900B company today, let’s ask what needs to happen to get it to $2T? I think a lot needs to go right over the next 5 years to get there. I think it does get to $2T or even $3T over time, but what is that time and risk worth for 2-3x upside that isn’t guaranteed. Let me give you a real world example. I’ve been heavy in Apple for a very long time. When they were a $1T company I sold a solid chunk of shares and diversified out into a lot of safer bets. Today Apple is a $3T company and those investments are up about 75% being diversified out. Would I have made more staying put? Sure but the risk wasn’t worth it. Not sure how much of your portfolio is in Tesla at $1100, but if it’s more than 20%, maybe consider why.",12,2022-02-21 04:08:58

If you can hold for the long term (1+ years) then I would say go for it, you will probably make money (especially if Tesla does a split which will certainly drive up the stock price).  If you can’t buckle up and hold for over a year then you might as well sell.

stocks,I bought TSLA in 2021 should I sell and take the L?,sxfvcy,As more people get margin calls it snowballs and down the hill it goes. Big money can see exactly who and how much is short and when they get margin calls. They can and will short it down to force you out and take your shares on the cheap on the way down. I was in that situation once and sold shares in my winners to cover a margin call due to a stock that was getting hammered. It was touch and go for a week but the hammered stock came back and I'm glad I held it. My winners I sold to cover margin call also dropped after I sold and I was able to buy back for about 10% less.  This was during the covid drop. I was down to $189k from $750k and on margin call. By shuffling stocks I got through it and up to $890k now.  Lesson learned. I never go that deep in margin now. About 50% cash now waiting for Russia war crash to play out and get back in.     As far As TSLA I stay away at these prices. I feel TSLA is priced like they are the only EV play there is. All car companies going EV and theri share prices are all too high due to the EV bubble. As far as I see they are all double where they should be. Several small EV companies are in play too now. Due to the competition and low profit on EVs I have no doubt sales of EVs will be high but profits will be low. If TSLA thinks they have the market to themselves they are mistaken. GM and Ford are coming up strong.  When I buy my first EV it will be GM or Ford. My fun EV will be a corvette or mustang. At some point TSLA will crash like FB. Right now TSLA is priced like they are the only EV maker in the world and all other car makers will do gas cars forever.,2,2022-02-21 06:51:47

If you have 100+ shares, bring it down to 100. Sell covered call leaps on the 100 shares you own. Be very very disciplined with this. Don't panic or don't try to overdo this. You can also look at repair strategy but discuss with someone who knows this first.

If you have less than 100. I would still sell a few shares and book a loss. Hold the rest for long term (2+ years)

Meanwhile do a lot of research on TSLA. Follow the stock well. Go deep so you have a good understanding of both the stock and the sector. Tsla has a lot of problems other than Elon Musk but it still is a pioneer ev stock.

Also, do a rethink of your portfolio. How much is ETF, good tech stocks, volatile stocks, gold ETF, bonds ETF etc.

stocks,I bought TSLA in 2021 should I sell and take the L?,sxfvcy,"Unless you're a short term trader (read: gambler), you'd be a fool to sell Tesla. For the first time in the company's history, it's starting to become cheaply valued if you account for growth, and the risks with the company are smaller than ever. Tesla has never, not even back when it was $100 just before it shot up to $900, looked this appealing. The risk/reward at the current valuation is insane. Imo the risk it goes down throughout this decade is close to 0, the chance it goes at least 3x is extremely large, there's still a very fair chance it goes 10x and if all the crazy AI stuff (FSD/Tesla bot/Autobidder/Dojo) works out the upside is unimaginable.

All of that said, this is the risk of using margin. Your decision is not whether you should sell Tesla, but whether you should continue to be on margin. That has nothing to do with the company and everything to do with the meta and your mental wellbeing, and is exactly the reason why you should never use margin for (long term) investing.",4,2022-02-21 10:53:50

It actually boggles my mind when I actually think about the construct stocks have become.

They're a share of the company, and with that comes the expectation of a share of the profits, normally in dividends. Stock growth was just about expectations of greater future profits, and thus eventually greater dividends.

The endgame was pretty simple: we found a balance point where we thought the return on future income from it was better than other alternatives.

And the next step which also made sense was that sometimes we could forgo dividends to put more money back into the company for greater future dividends.

But eventually we got to this point where you were buying companies who had no plans to release dividends for the foreseeable future, putting everything into growth and everyone being ok with that.

The prices are no longer really related to what you'll actually get from it, it's just based on the belief that soon there will be someone who will pay more for the company.

And if there ever is a selloff the only real base of support for the price are the assets, and finding new believers because there are no dividends. I mean sure, they could start putting out dividends, but that's only enough support for a fraction of the prices many of these companies are selling for. People looking for 8% returns are not going to be satisfied with 1-2% dividends. It feels like the price basis of stocks is hopes and dreams.

I know this sounds like the ravings of a lunatic. And I'm not backing it with my actions. I'm invested(though I'm thoroughly internationally diversified, to be safe), but while I understood what stocks represented before, nowadays it feels more and more like a ponzi scheme just counting on there always to be a greater fool to push the prices higher?

However she forgets something.

The companies that will benefit from the innovation may not be the ones she is currently holding.

I will give you two examples.
Back in 1998 there was this company pets.com which predict that the future for pet food and other stuff delivery will be online. Nobody will go to supermarket to buy 20kg food bags for their dogs, or 10 kg sand for cats they will simply order it online and have it delivered at their home

They were listed at stock market and investors were waiting insane returns. 


24 years later we can most definitely confirm that their predictions were right. Myself having a cat never bought anything from the supermarket the past 2 years. Prefer to purchase online and I guess everyone is doing the same.

So the pets.com company should worth billions and the people who invested back in 1999 should be millionaires, correct?

NO. Company declared bunkrupcy somewhere in 2002-2003 and people lost all their money.

Another example is email.
Back in mid 1990s Yahoo predicted that in the future everyone will communicate through email rather than telephones or postal mails.

Everyone was thinking the same, so their stock was one of the most valuable at the peak of dot com bubble.

So Yahoo shareholders should now be millionaires correct?

Again NO.

Conclusion. Being right about the future does not mean that the company that you bet will lead you to this future will be the winner.

You may be correct and still lose all your money. Maybe someone  better will come along the way and he will lead us into this innovative future

There are a few exceptional companies, yes, but the majority of new tech stocks need to sort out their business models and gain a solid footing before they can get such high valuation.

The macroeconomic indicators will have more bearing on the stock market over the next year IMO and this does not bode well for all the sky-high priced tech stocks.

Having said that, most of my assets are in tech index funds and I'm adding to them every week so there's that (also getting some world stock indexes, a few REITs that I like and also physical gold funds to balance out inflation). I just think we need to be realistic. This year will be great for building positions, lets wait till 2023/4 to cash them.

Historically speaking, such sectors have dramatically outperformed hot, innovative sectors. Professor Jeremy Siegel wrote a great book about this called *The Future for Investors: Why the Tried and the True Triumph Over the Bold and the New*. 

The issue with hot sectors is that they attract lots of capital, and with it, lots of competition. At the same time, these companies get priced at absurd valuations as people extrapolate high growth rates into the very distant future. A great recipe for disappointment.

""If I could avoid a single stock, it would be the hottest stock in the hottest industry, the one that gets the most favorable publicity, the one that every investor hears about in the carpool or on the commuter train – and succumbing to the social pressure, often buys.""

- Peter Lynch 

""I very frequently get the question: 'What's going to change in the next 10 years?' And that is a very interesting question; it's a very common one. I almost never get the question: 'What's not going to change in the next 10 years?'

First, the Tuttle inverse ETF is not shorting innovation in general. It's just shorting Wood's ""Innovation"" fund. The former is only true if the ARK fund is representative of innovation in general, and it's not. Saying it's ""innovation"" does not make it so. I also find it entertaining that she tries to appeal to American culture by implying that innovation is innately American, which is like saying, ""If you short my funds, you're un-American."" Ridiculous.

Second, the components that ARK owns are only innovative if they actually succeed in changing something about the world, but some of these components haven't changed anything (yet), and there are several components that I can't really see being terribly innovative in any way. Like... How is Draft Kings going to change the world? How is Spotify going to change the world? Some of these companies are just tech-oriented or big on the often transient sentiment of pop-culture (fads). These properties don't make a company innovative. They make them popular.

And lastly, while technology will likely continue to advance into the future, it is not the only factor to consider when we think about whether its sector should be in a bull or bear market. It's not as if the dot-com bear market happened because people thought the Internet would fail, but because people just got far too enthusiastic about the idea, and they paid far too much to own a piece of that idea. The same could be said about some of the more hyped up business idea of today.

We have enough problems with supply chains as it is and gas prices are already sky high. The last thing the economy needs right now is more supply chain disruption and a further spike in gas prices. That will drag on the economy while pushing inflation even higher. If the economy was strong then sure, sell the news, but at this point an invasion into Ukraine would significantly raise the risk of a FED policy error and perhaps even put us on a path to a minor recession.

On a personal note, I'm getting so fed up with the Ukraine/Russia news. Every day for several weeks I've been told an invasion into Ukraine is imminent. If it doesn't happen this week then we need to start discounting the likelihood of it happening at all. I'm convinced Putin is just doing this as leverage against NATO or is trying to gauge what kind of response they might expect from the West if they ever did decide to invade Ukraine. Seriously, if he's going to invade why is he taking so long to do it? I guess it's kind of cool of him to give Ukrainian's so much time to prepare for an attack and for the West to send them arms.

There is plenty of suggestion that the Cold War merely subdued, and never ended. Over here in the UK our govt are posturing, pretending to hold some authority over Russia - I believe we are attending a peace type summit today. 

I also know that what our media speculates is often not accurate, I have been reading the FT all week which is particularly indecisive about Biden and Putin right now. In the last 48 ish house I’ve read articles with titles insisting this will be resolved democratically, and also insisting that Russia is going to invade.

We do not know what Russia will do, but I think what we can say is no leader/nation can control Russia. Putin will do what is in the best interest of his nation, and his views and moralities are not aligned with those here on Reddit. He is undoubtedly more extreme than western governments ‘appear to be’ but appearances are really important for maintaining stability. 

As for profiting from this situation, it is simply too volatile for most of us to be able to make any call with conviction, therefore it comes as always back to your risk appetite. Markets aren’t filled with perfect scoring ESG companies but it is disgusting to hear this news and develop dollar signs in your eyes. The world has a mix of people, and those are not my people. 

My thoughts go out to so many different parties, those trying to maintain diplomacy, Ukraine’s public - which if being exposed to the same types of news we are, are undoubtedly stressed at the moment, and soldiers on both sides who maybe asked to lay their lives on the line for politicians. 

Here is to hoping diplomacy will prevail, and ultimately the market wobble means you’re getting a discount on your stocks, and that no lives will be lost.",7,2022-02-19 13:11:33

Not because they are not great company or they they will have a bad earnings but due to negative sentiment against Chinese stocks.

And BABA is not trying to create shareholders value on the short run.

They had investors day back in December (when price was already at 5 years lows) and they said nothing how to increase shareholders value. They concentrated mainly how they will spend the 15billion ""common prosperity tax"" that CCP impose to them because they are too successful.

Maybe it is the difference in mentality between East and west.
When a growth stock is so undervalued in US insiders go crazy buying stocks and advertise on all the news to support it.

Imagine the positive impact it will had if Jack Ma suddenly announced he bought xxx shares at xxx price.
If Jack Ma ( or any other  high profile officer) buying shares this will be revelation and short term downtrend could come to an end.

But they will not do it. Although the business is great, generating tons of cash every quarter, this lack of support for their stock, may lead it even lower.

Even if earnings are great we could see 10-15% decline (ser NVDIA) for no reason at all.

The elites will never hold more power than the government as long as Xi rules, and he has taken steps to prevent it so far. BABA seems to be diversifying to work around the limits the CCP sets. But eventually, there will be a crackdown. A Chinese bull run is destined eventually, but the Chinese economy and more importantly real estate market are made out of paper and glue made in china and sold in the USA.

In mid-late Jan, there was like a 10% drop - ""I am a f-ing genius, rushed in to buy the dip""; by mid March-April, lost $300K and got out of it.

It taught me a valuable lesson, max out retirement accounts with low cost mutual funds and save 15% cash of yearly income for emergencies, after that than purchase blue chips names and reinvest dividends.

Then and only then develop a 5-10 stock speculative portfolio that you did a lot of DD. For me, more than 10 is difficult to keep current.

It also taught me to have a strategy on both the upside run and to manage downside risk (if any drops by 15-20% I am out but will watch). On the upside, I take profits at 25% and if its 50%, I sell 1/2 - 1/3 and let the remainder ride and not really tracking it. (Today those stocks include FB, BABA, CC, AMD, and LLY.)

So when the crash happen in 2008, I was well positioned and rode it out. Retiring early 7 years ago and been enjoying the good life.

Today, I have a speculative portfolio to keep my mind active.

Just started out a career in tech, had money to lose and thought that there is no way that tech is ever going away. I was right, but also very wrong. Here is a list of all the mistakes I made:
1. Did not diversify, put all of the money in a couple of stocks.
2. Did not DCA (debatable, but I think it's important psychologically).
3. No research on pricing whatsoever, I just liked the stock.
4. Once it crashed, I assumed it will bounce back. It never did.

Ended up selling at a loss of about 50% a few years later.
For someone going through this for the first time, I would say that the same type of fallacies that got you in this mess, can make it even worse. Don't assume that any given stock has to bounce back up to your cost basis, don't assume you will be able to stomach 10 years of sideways trading. Try to reassess the entire situation as if you are now having to decide whether to invest in your portfolio at the current price. If you think it's a good deal, great, hold the line.

Everyone forgets that the end of dot com didn't really happen until a year after 9/11/2001.  Dot com wasn't just unprofitable tech stocks tanking but the fear of war & security in USA. The aftermath of 9/11 led people to invest in their homes or buy a home.  Commodity prices rallied hard until the 2008 crash.  People started investing in Gold and the S&P basically just recovered to even from the dot com & 9/11 crash to barely even before 2008.  We had a market rotation from tech.

2008 was brutal.  2008 was a recession and fear of the banks falling so everything including stocks, Gold, US Dollar, and Commodities all crashed.   I lost over 50% and I was pretty well diversified between stocks, Gold, tech, and Blue Chips with little exposures to real estate and that still turned me off from investing for over 5 years.  There's a lesson about buying the dip too hard and losing too much money too fast that it leaves scars where you leave the market.  My advise to everyone that has lost a lot of money is to take a break for a month or 2 before adding in any additional cash.  Sure you might miss the bottom, but if this follows dot com market, the recovery will not happen for another 6 months- year.  It's better mentally to buy at a bit higher on the way back up and miss the bottom than have to wait 5 years to break even by continuing to try and catch a falling knife, and the risk you becoming discouraged and miss the rebound like I did after 2008.",4,2022-02-22 03:01:19

I happened to have a big payout from a contract in beginning 2009, put it into companies that I knew would never go under, like constellation brands.  Got another contract end of 2009 that paid well and dumped that into some more companies that would survive, like Chase and Walmart.

Then I bought a home on the beach for a steal in October 2010.  It is three times what I paid for it today. Bought some cheap land in Panama (which weathered the storm well) with two friends that some Americans needed to get rid of.  That's turned out well. 

Last year I ""discovered"" I had forgotten a 403b with 70k in it from a job I forgot I had been adding to.  I rolled it into my IRA and am sitting on that 70k just as the market could go tits up soon. 

No one who knows me is surprised by these events, as I've literally cheated death like 3 times.  I'm a pretty lucky dude, who just happened to have a gypsy grandmother who probably cast a luck spell on me. Lol",2,2022-02-22 00:37:56

I was in treasuries leading up to 2008 so I actually made about 100% in 2008 and made a killing in 2009 when I bought the crash...

Im down about 15% this year. I had very little tech coming into this year (maybe 15%) so I didnt get hit very hard. Most of my tech was just MSFT, QCOM and AMZN. Now I have about 25% tech after buying into this dip too early which is why im down a bit.

Tech isnt what most folks around here think it is. Its not what idiots like Cathy claim they are either. Tech isnt always innovative and even when it is, its all about change and they change more than anyone else. They have a very high rate of startup failure similar to experimental biotechs so folks need to learn how to mitigate this risk and not load up on tech. Also, the word ""tech"" has been abused by recent investors and attached to anything that uses a computer it seems. Tech is about innovation that cannot easily be duplicated hence giving the company an inherent competitive advantage. Many things being called tech today, isnt. But they were inflated based on lofty valuations anyway by sheep.

I live and breathe tech and have my entire life and despite my love for science and tech, I barely invested into them. I find it alarming how young folks have almost no sense of risk mitigation. They own almost no cyclicals or consumer staples in their portfolio except by passive funds perhaps. Seems they are all trying to hit a home run and no one wants to hit singles or doubles any more.

stocks,'Palantir isn't a palatable stock even after its big decline'.,syvlns,"I feel really good about PLTR. I think a lot of the negativity surrounding the stock comes from jaded people who wanted to make a quick buck and were burned by buying at the top of the post-IPO phase with losses compounded by a general market turndown. We will get back there, but it'll take a year or two or three, maybe even four or five. Like much of our politics, most negative comments are emotional rhetoric rather than fact-based dialogue. 

Mathematically, PLTR is hitting or near-missing all important earning/financial benchmarks and guidance. Fundamentally, PLTR is building a robust moat by developing and marketing a data management and analysis ecosystem that is technologically top of the line/most advanced in the market. Once its software is more widely known in the commercial market, I think it will very quickly start to be adopted by big name companies with complex data needs. Anecdotally, I work in the DoD, I've used their software in a deployed, combat environment, and trust me, we in the DoD know about shitty computers/software. Working with Palantir's software made me a believer in their quality, their ability to turn seemingly disparate, extremely diverse and complicated data, into actionable analyses/results. Further, I have recent Comp Sci  college graduate friends and during career day, while the top 10-20% go to FAANG, only the top ~5% are even looked at and given offers to work at Palantir.

All this to say, I'm bullish in the medium- and long-term. Current market conditions are poor, drops have nothing to do with individual stocks' performances and so while the market is generally down, I will continue DCAing further into PLTR now and over the next year. For clarity and SA, I have 6200 shares with a $17 cost average.",133,2022-02-22 23:08:27

stocks,'Palantir isn't a palatable stock even after its big decline'.,syvlns,"PLTR is going through an S curve. Slow adoption and growth at first (government contracts only) and are now breaking into commercial sector (NATO alliance only).

The share based comp dilutes the share price but it’s pretty interesting seeing the misunderstanding people have. The float has gone up because the company is using its stock as a currency to pay out for talent. 

The company has actually had minimal share issuance since their direct listing, as a matter of fact, even the SBC is slowing down year over year. 

The company is 424M positive free cash flow, no debt, and has a stable foundational client with government contracts. So if you think the shares will go to $0, then perhaps you dont understand what holding equity truly means. There’s almost zero chance of bankruptcy risk where debt holders wipe equity holders and the company is taken over by debt holders. Because there’s no debt… 

So depending on one’s stomach for volatility, you can buy and own a unique company that has the track record for execution, at the highest and national security levels of demanding.

This is a long hold and see how they grow their commercial side of the business. The nearest competitor people assume is snowflake, but snowflake might not be the one. Instead, I believe it’s $CRM. They are slowly taking over every silo of enterprise software/data. CRM, project management, slack, workday (via partnership), etc. the vision is to have a unified system where every application sends through a stream of data for analysis on one platform. $CRM is trying to do this by being that unified vendor.

I believe the opposite to be the real future, that PLTR foundry is the unified platform wrapping all enterprise apps and collecting the streams of data for analysis.

So it’s either a 90% haircut (not 100% because there’s no bankruptcy risk) or a 20X return based on DCF modeling from these levels, as the company grows through its high growth segment of S curve.

People really allow price action to dictate their narrative, but stock prices doesn’t always follow product development and adoption here. As wallstreet analysts aren’t systems engineers. EPS has nothing to do with how the PLTR platform is being deployed and used by new customers who signed multi million dollar deals. I would change my hypothesis if I have facts that show customers are dumping the core product after several years of deployment and usage, but I have not seen that. Quite the opposite with how sticky they are.

It’s a good risk/return bet for me, but if you can’t stomach the volatility, go buy $GOOG or $AAPL. (Which I also own a lot of as well)",63,2022-02-22 22:28:10

*disclaimer: I do own the stock

The company itself has some strong fundamentals & leadership.

The company for one, does not provide absurd or unachievable goals. If you look at their revenue guidance, they keep it at a sustainable 30% revenue growth until FY2025.

This goal hasn't changed at all the past 2 years I believe.

I personally like this, because it shows that the management knows their company, they are more concerned with building the product than just improving stock price.

The company exhibits pretty robust growth, and it has very very little amount of debt.

Its margins are also improving well.

stocks,'Palantir isn't a palatable stock even after its big decline'.,syvlns,"I've posted my position size on PLTR on here before, but overall very very bullish. 

On 12/31/2021, I sold all of my options and half of my stock position (6000 shares that I had purchased above my cost basis of $18 at the time) at roughly $18.21 a share for tax purposes, and risk management (technicals were looking a bit ugly for the short term).

I've started to reallocate my capital back into Palantir starting around $12 a share, and it looks like i'll get back to my 12,000 tally at a cost basis of $14 or less.

I recently interviewed with Palantir for a TPM role, and in the process I got to see their products in action. Can't disclose too much due to NDA, but it confirmed my thesis (that Palantir is trying to help enterprise companies develop their Digital Twins), and it bolstered my conviction very strongly.

Not to mention, they are hitting all their financial metrics. Commercial sector is growing rapidly, and the government side continues to provide PLTR a moat. They have 3B in cash, 0 debt, and are expected to compound the top line by 30% for the next 5 years (this is probably sandbagged by management), and possibly even the next decade. Their gross margins are very healthy at nearly 80%, they are profitable (ignoring SBC, and they are finally set to reach their fully diluted share count of 2.17B by 2023), and actually have a pretty healthy 2% FCF yield which is fantastic for this macro climate (and rare for growth companies).

Lastly, PLTR are hiring some of the world's best top top notch talent (much higher level of talent than FAAMG imo), and their leadership seems to recognize their issues and consistently works to improve them (such as modularizing Foundry or expanding their salesforce). 

From an Elliot Wave perspective, it's looking like PLTR will bottom out in the $8-9 range, and I'll happily add more at those prices. This is a very long term play, but I'm very confident I'll make money on this over the next 5-8 years. To people looking for comparisons - look at Salesforce, ServiceNow, or Adobe - some of the earliest SaaS compounders that grew at 20-25% for over a decade. That's the type of company we're looking at with PLTR. Everything else is just noise.",1,2022-02-23 03:56:36
stocks,'Palantir isn't a palatable stock even after its big decline'.,syvlns,"I bought into PLTR at the wrong time, could have sold for a small profit, and ended up selling for a small loss.

Ultimately, I think what they’re doing in the data space remains compelling. It ran away with itself between being memed, and the frothing market of the last 2 years. However, I think it could fall further. I intend to get back in if it goes to the $5-7 range.

For me, the dilution is excessive; and seems primarily focused on rewarding the company’s exec.

Also, most mutual funds’ investment goal is not to “beat the market”. It is to pick winning stocks in a specific segment of the market (large cap growth, large cap value, emerging markets, fixed income, etc).

False. That's an exaggeration. The actual stats are

>Over the past 10 years, 82% of fund managers fell short of their S&P 500 benchmark, with 87% failing over 15 years.

[https://www.ginsglobal.com/articles/80-of-us-fund-managers-underperform-sp-500-over-5-years/](https://www.ginsglobal.com/articles/80-of-us-fund-managers-underperform-sp-500-over-5-years/)

That means almost 20% beat the S&P 500 over 10 years, and more than 1 in 10 beat it over 15 years. It's difficult but not impossible.

Individual investors also have an advantage over professional fund managers. As hundreds of millions, or billions, of dollars flow into their funds the managers are forced to buy lesser performing stocks to avoid over-concentration in their best stocks and to maintain diversification. That dilutes the effects of their top performers and lowers overall performance. They tend to regress to the mean.

Individual investors do not have that problem. They can concentrate on their best performers and aren't forced to buy lesser performing stocks.

Individual investors also have another advantage over Wall Street professionals. As Peter Lynch, the legendary manager of the Fidelity Magellan Fund who beat the S&P 500 for many years, explained in his book *One Up On Wall Street*:

>America’s most successful money manager tells how average investors can beat the pros by using what they know. According to Lynch, investment opportunities are everywhere. From the supermarket to the workplace, we encounter products and services all day long. By paying attention to the best ones, we can find companies in which to invest before the professional analysts discover them. When investors get in early, they can find the “tenbaggers,” the stocks that appreciate tenfold from the initial investment. A few tenbaggers will turn an average stock portfolio into a star performer.",55,2022-02-22 06:36:43

“Why do you try to beat the fishery if the people who fish for a living cannot? Do you think you are smarter than they are, or that fisheries bear some resemblance to anything other than chaos? Is it a gambling thing? Is it fun? Any insight into why you fish would be highly appreciated.”

There is a weird fucking logic in your questioning, so that’s why I’m laying it out this way.

If I was trying to fish 40 hours a week to outperform the fishery industry… yes. The industry would do better than my boating operation.

But you see. I have fish whenever I want. It’s  actually delivered right to me. Additionally, I go fishing a few times a year, and when I do I catch my limit.

Could I catch my limit every day if I did it 40 hours a week every week? Nope. That’s why there are fisheries. Do I need to set up a fishery to eat fish? No. But I have fish whenever I want and if I want even more fish, I can literally go out to the water and get some. 

401k. Employer match. Dividend portfolio. A slice of every paycheck into crypto. And just by setting those mechanisms in place, I am at pace with the market.

Now. There is an additional 20k I start with every year. And the goal is to turn it into 40k by the end of the year. Why? With that metric of success, I only need to be smart enough to make plays when it makes sense. Not do it 40 hours a week every week. And with that logic, that approach. I do beat the market. Every year. And I didn’t need to do it as a living. Fuck it’s just a hobby that makes a shit ton of money. Once you have enough in your trading account… say… 100k. And you are watching the green line gap up. Put your 100k into that green line. In two minutes, when it goes up 1%, pull it back out. Hey. You just made $1k. It’s that simple. Do I need to fully manage and track all market movement? Nope. Do I need to diversify that $100k into a bunch of little 2% risks? Nope. Why? Because it’s not my job to. I can’t do that for 40 hours a week every week. And besides, my other investments are keeping pace with the market. And being all diversified and shit. But every now and then I can watch the charts for a few hours, dip in and dip out and come away with a few grand.

So really. What the fuck are you even asking? Because fisheries exist… why should people even fish?  clearly fisheries are the most economical operation because they run at such a high scale. And if you try to fish 24/7 you’re not going to beat the fishery. Sure. Ok. But yet, I use fisheries for my daily fish and every weekend I catch my limit, so clearly I’m in the 2%, based in your statistics.

But I think there is also a fallacy in your question, and it relates to risk. Risk and performance are managed and measured differently depending on whose money it is. When it’s a mutual fund manager, they are looking for measured growth of someone else’s money. And if I was managing the monies of 200 clients 24/7 I’d sure as hell be risk averse. So when they are ‘trying to beat the market’ they are trying to beat it weekly/quarterly/sustainable growth/etc, and that’s a whole lot of shit to balance while also trying to keep up to the market. A client doesn’t want to hear “hey, your portfolio manager is fucking awesome. The money in your account stays flat all year until one weekend he gets drunk, reads a bunch of Reddit, and then doubles it Monday and Tuesday , and really then fucks off for the rest of the year cuz he did better than the guy down the block.” No - people don’t want THAT KIND OF PERFORMANCE. They want the performance where they can log into their account every week and see it slowly growing through strategic decisions based on market movement. That’s a completely different metric of success than just measuring the number at the end of the year.

So yeah. I beat the market every fucking year. Using stupid and unconventional ways. And those ways only work once and are not reproducible. And highly risky. And, if offered as a mutual fund management service, would be irresponsible and have the potential to collapse at any point (but never does). But it outperforms the market. And it can do that because it’s not using the same daily risk assessment as conventional mutual fund management. 

TLDR: you posited that the only metric of success for a mutual fund manager is to beat the market (which it’s not) and then assumed that clearly mutual fund managers are the best at XYZ because they do it all the time (also not true) and you need to know why we all want to be mutual fund managers (we don’t) when they aren’t very good at their job (based on a single metric that is skewing your measurements). 

Personal risk is easier to manage. People beat the market all the time and they aren’t included in your statistics. It’s actually quite easy. Don’t be thick.

Also, hedge funds arent strictly to create wealth. They are a ""hedge"" fund. They are meant to hedge risk to preserve wealth in down times as well. But bottom line. People just want to get lucky whether thats on one stock or many. A lot of people out there have outperformed the market by a large sum and created life changing wealth.

Any capital weighted index (aka the market) is investing more in the best performing stocks, because they are beating the market resulting in a trading range more or less around the a long term average growth.

Theoretically:

buying in phases below the average and selling above, you will never beat market, but you will beat the long term average. 

In other words, you can beat 8-10%, but you can’t beat the market with the capital you have invested. 

Problem is, you have less capital invested, resulting in a loss of performance in a growing market unless you have a second market to invest in that is also performing similar over time AND is below average then the other one is above. 

IF you get the timing right, you still need to outperform by more than fees plus the growth your missing with your capital not invested or invested in the market performing worse.

1. Liquidity: If I see that a business is weaker than I thought, or I don't like a comment made by the CEO -  I can get out instantly. Fund managers can't.
2. Long term vision: If you under perform for several quarters you are out. Fund managers could not buy oil stocks during the pandemic crash even if they wanted to. They would have made tremendous gains.
3. Smaller companies. Often the smaller companies have more volatility -  something which fund managers don't like or can't invest into due to size. 
4. Group think: Most fund managers act like a group. If you under perform and have odd holdings in non-popular industries - you are often shunned or looked down.
5. Edges: If you have hobbies etc you have incredible knowledge in certain areas. Combine those with valuation work and chances are very high, that you can beat market analysts.

I did made a post about it. Well you definitely can't beat the market if you can't understand that little.

On top of what i mentioned the juice of what they are doing is not beating the market, its attracting the customers, preferably rich people and all their friends and taking fees. 

For example 1% fee of 100 mil spinning around is a mil directly into your pocket, extracted from the system, just free money right there. Meanwhile they will act like they have a huge office of busy smart office people managing your fund 24/7 with smart math and calculations, but in many cases its just 2 guys and they are spending most of their time on vacation.

Financial experts are not trying to beat the market, they are only trying to attract clients, customers.

I don't even bother except occasionally arguing that tech is going to recover after its 25th correction and to buy low and sell high while masses have the opposite sentiment.

My comment being burried and never read is just going to add to the hilarity of how things echo chamber here.

You are a grown up, figure shit out for yourself.

Now time to put on a tinyfoil hat, the rich the ruling class would benefit more not from people trying to beat the market, blowing up all their money and leaving it forever like in dot com bubble, but from people investing in funds, etf and such, dca every single month for the next 40 years, they money that would flood the market would be way more than someone gambling it all away one time. Nice way to guarantee boomer retirements.

While individual stock pickers often show signs of gambling and we all know that and have seen that, on opposite spectrum index fund investors show cult like behavior and they are always in comment sections and making posts trying to recruit more people to their behavior. Even though they are not market participants and their strategy doesn't change whatever happens to it, they always feel the need to come into discussions and try to prove every stock picker wrong.

I was right and wrong. Right to buy stocks in general during such a calamitous year, wrong on which stocks to buy. I'm pretty sure the etf would have netted me the same % returns with much lower risk.

That being said; the statistics are right until they are not. I do not place too much faith in passive investing; who knows how long this strategy will remain foolproof?

Also, do statistics account for:

1. If the fund managers were unencumbered by the restrictions on their investing activities and the culture of hedgefunds, would they be able to beat the market more handily? If investors at mutual funds had no fees, would they beat the market?

Yes, ""statistically"" speaking you are less likely to beat the market, but what does this statistic consists of?

How many investors do DD? How many investors even open a damn earnings report? How many listen to earnings calls? Shit, I even listen to earnings calls of stocks that I bought for dividend alone (Realty Income is an example of that). How many investors understand that even if a company is good, it does not mean that it isn't overpriced? How many of those in these statistics are traders and of those how many think chart history has any affect on future price, ignoring fundamentals and macro events?

Every time I see this bs I remember that I have a friend who bought NDAQ thinking it is the Nasdaq index, this is your statistic. You think he sold out of that after I told him? Nope, he is still holding NDAQ months after.

Mutual funds don't beat the market? Do they actually try to? Mutual funds have multiple different analysts covering many different fields. Mutual funds diversify to reduce risk which reduces their upside as well. Mutual fund analysts are people, and as such they have the same flaws most people have of chasing winners (just look at the constant price upgrades when companies run up), emotions and psychology. I will always look back at all the mutual funds that sold out of Pfizer near the bottom after the full FDA approval. I've made 25% in Pfizer in the 4 months I've held it, out of which it ran up 40% in 2 months from said bottom, where I sold it at the top.

Since I sold out of Pfizer I have been looking into SoFi, among others, and buying heavily into it. When I first looked at it, I think there were about 30% institutional holding I think. Now the institutional holding are already at 50% of float.

And this statistic, when was it researched? Was it researched when retail investors had full and easy access to sec filings and earnings calls? Or was it 20-30 years ago where you had no access to those unless you were a fund?",1,2022-02-22 10:32:39
stocks,"Statistically speaking, you can't beat the market. Why do you try? (Serious)",syf4u1,"When I get asked how to invest, I just advise people to DCA into an index fund every month. Most people like to flock to meme stocks or tech at inflated prices, so parking in index funds diligently is the best for the majority of people. 

I enjoy researching stocks, I enjoy betting on a horse that I think will win long term. It's exciting, akin to gambling but with the odds going with you. I don't think I'm smarter than hedge funders but those guys have different targets. Their aim is to grow the size of their fund as quickly as possible and that means quick results and to beat the market in the short run. This means taking risks chasing the hottest meme stocks for the short run gains. When it crashes, regular people hold the bag, but it's too late, your in the fund already. They've already made their commissions and fees.

If you follow the school of Buffett, Munger, Prabai and other value investors, they consistently beat the market. But their bets are very long term and you can't see the results for a few years on average. No hedge fund manager can wait that long to see results. I'm trying to apply value investing principles to my circle of competence to see if I can beat the market. I can also wait and be patient like the mentioned value investors. 

Also I've stopped drinking as much and doing other stupid things with my money since picking up investing. I find it a win win. If I put my money in just index funds, I'll probably go back to spending my money on random things that are 100 percent lost money. So yeah, I like gambling with the odds going for me (value investing). I don't chase meme stocks and I never buy over valued stocks, so I'm good so far. Have fell for value traps but I don't know if it's a trap yet. Being too early is the same as being wrong.",1,2022-02-22 11:03:25

stocks,"Statistically speaking, you can't beat the market. Why do you try? (Serious)",syf4u1,"I disagree with your assessment.  I don't think you fully understand hedge funds.  They aren't supposed to beat the market.  By design they are hedging the downside so that people who are already rich have more steady returns and also have a shorter time line.  Also big banks are not as nimble as small traders.  You can't just take a 1m position in SoFi and not effect the stock price.  You end up driving the price as the ask disappears.  You have to take smaller positions over time.  

As for statistics, they exist because people dabble.  They don't actually put the real time in and get frustrated withing a year or two, or don't have the maturity to hold/stick with a plan.  Money and emotions are something most people in this country lack control.  What is it, something like 85% of people can't handle an unexpected bill of $1000?!  So context matters.  

And lastly, I don't want to be comfortable.  I'm already going to be comfortable with my retirement as a teacher and social security along with my investment into index funds.  The trading/investment money is there to either loose say 50% realistically or eventually make me hit another tier of wealth.  So one day managing about 1mil in capital.  Sitting still and just investing into mutual funds/401k/index will get me there with DCA but it will take till Im old and grey.  I want to do it in 20 years.",1,2022-02-22 11:05:51

stocks,"Statistically speaking, you can't beat the market. Why do you try? (Serious)",syf4u1,"While I wholeheartedly agree that it is impossible to time the market I am not sure what exactly ""beating the market"" means.

If market = s&p500 (which it isn't) then it was possible to beat it. All you had to do was pick a different index (eg. NASDAQ) instead of s&p.

I don't know why there is a prevalent idea that s&p500 is the best index out there and if you beat it you were lucky. I certainly heaven't beaten it YTD but have beaten it significantly last year. Mainly because I hold the digital asset that *shall not be named*.  I'm nkt claiming I'm able to beat it. I'm just saying you should diversify more and not think about beating it. You can buy whatever. Gold, real estate, art or any other stuff or instrument you know something about (the more the better of course).

 In my opinion a good investor owns assets that are generating profit at all times and not necessarily beats an index on an average investing day. If that means making a risky investment with a small portion of your assets you should go ahead. 

That being said, buying s&p is certainly a million times better than buying individual stocks because of the shape of its chart. I just can't wrap my head around why people think this can be done.",1,2022-02-22 11:18:08

I do pick some individual stocks because there are also times when fear can depress stock values much more then they deserve. So I usually buy value stocks when they are depressed for some reason external to the company.  

I also buy and hold and the bulk of dividend paying stocks grow their dividends. So a portfolio that was originally a 25K investment usually throws off 1-2K in dividends a year. So more in income then the same money sitting in a bank account plus I have capital appreciation. 

I bought BA at 50.00 a share years ago. I bought BAC at 4.25 during the last housing crash. It was “too big to fail” and had been caught up in the depression of all banks. When the Enron fiasco occurred I bought a few utilities because the whole sectors prices were depressed after that.

stocks,"Statistically speaking, you can't beat the market. Why do you try? (Serious)",syf4u1,"This is a terrible misconception. Fun managers and institutions are beholden to many rules and short term interests that prevent them from being able to outperform the market, or in some situations even WANTING to outperform the market. For a fund manager, managing downside is much more important than achieving upside, because even temporary downturns is what causes you to lose clients.

As an individual investor, it's much easier to outperform the market than people think. You literally only need to get one investment really right. For example, anyone who had 10%+ in Tesla in late 2019/early 2020 outperformed the market that year regardless of what other stocks you owned.

There are plenty of investors that saw Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Tesla, Bitcoin, etc. ahead of time. Anyone who realized these opportunities probably outperformed the market. The only reason many don't manage that is because they don't put in the work. You need to research companies, products, earnings reports/calls, interviews with leadership, etc. If you do that and you have the right mindset, there's a much larger chance than 2% you end up outperforming the market.

On top of that, just because you're unlikely to outperform the market doesn't mean you shouldn't try. If you invest safe, even if you underperform the market you're a lot more likely to generate wealth because you have a bigger incentive to save and probably still make some kind of ROI.

Also, only 0.x% of all people laying sports, making music, etc. become professionals, but that doesn't mean nobody should try to be successful.

And then all of that aside, even if you don't outperform the market, it's fun and educational, not just as an investor but also as an entrepreneur and for overall understanding of the world.",1,2022-02-22 12:11:59

2. Separately I buy index funds
3. I also play with individual stocks and other investments

I don’t have to beat the market with my individual investment choices, but sometimes I do.

In fact quite a few of my individual stock picks are out performing the index funds I’ve invested in at the moment.

Do I think I’m as smart as the people at mutual funds? Yes. I do.  Many of them went to the same school and I work at a Fortune 50 as my day job.

Do I have all the tech at their disposal? Maybe not. But I’ve got a calculator and the internet, the internet can be really useful.  You can find a lot out on a company going through their public records and reading literature about industries companies are in and long term prospects.

Have I read a shit ton on investing? Yes, I have.  And not ZeroHedge or MotleyFool or any of these internet hucksters.  I mean tomes thicker than the Bible written by authors that really successful people recommended that a lot of these professional fund managers got assigned but didn’t read in college.

So I’m doing ok.  I don’t always “beat the market” but then I don’t need to as I’ve diversified for that. If I don’t beat the market my index funds will spare me any major pain, and then I’ve got a professional managing a 401k.  But that said, I’m doing as well as they are or better right now with the market being what it is.  

My personal picks for investments are roughly 13.5% index funds and 28% technology - but not the big ones that were due for a correction and are getting hit hard right now.  I prefer value stocks so I’m doing well there. 

Biggest losses right now are in automaker stocks, as I had a lot in EVs (not TSLA).  A little under 11% of my personal investments are in EVs, another 4% in conventional automakers shifting to EVs and those picks are doing well compared to the more start up type investments.  But I’m holding because I’m confident they will become profitable and I wasn’t buying them expecting gains in the short term and nothing has changed for them that would indicate they’re bad picks.

The other major losses, the biggest losses by far, are hydrogen stocks, but I’m also confident in those long term and didn’t expect immediate gains either, with the entire market in a downward trend I am not alarmed by this and still believe that they’re a good long term buy.

All that to say, I don’t need to beat the market, this is just what I do with my extra cash because I enjoy it and I like to take the personal responsibility to play against index funds and my professional money management people to see if I can beat them, and right now I’m doing pretty well for myself so I don’t expect that I’ll stop. 

It’s either this or pissing more money away on hobbies that don’t have potential monetary returns.

I don’t think NOK will ever go red for me unless we go into a straight up depression.

Same for KO.  

Even HPE has been a solid gainer for me and Is still up.

I bought commodity producers and sold tech and growth over the next 6 months.  These were easy things to predict and I’ve made tons.  That won’t show up as beating an index.

I think American large cap stocks are so well understood and regulated that its hard to beat the market.

With that said, I don't think things are as bad as that number suggests. Most funds do not aim to beat the market - they offer to invest in the best value stocks, or the best growth stocks, or oil stocks, or whatever. Even active funds. The expectation is that the investor will rotate in and out of them as conditions change. Other funds aim to have lower volatility, or uncorrelated gains, or other things incompatible with beating the S&P.

You don't complain an articulated lorry is slower than the average car. The active underperformance figures are a little unfair.

You do expect a low cost passive funds specialist to argue that those are the best option, even if they have to be a little unfair, and the same for a big active manager like schroders, so we have rival statistical reports from both that reach opposite conclusions. Which is misleading?

I think we need to understand our own needs and our options and do the right thing for us, or at least get advice.

Even Boggle said you should have a few different indexes and assets in your portfolio. Once you start picking indexes and assets you are an active investor, and you cannot avoid making such a decision if you are investing at all.

We used to run on the gold standard: country has Xgrams of gold and Xdollar bills each dollar bill is worth = Xgrams/Xdollar
Now that we are a global economy worth of money is based on circulation of that money. If you're country trades less the value of the dollar goes down.

stocks,Wait for the dip after the dip of the dip before buying or averaging down? What’s your opinions on here?,szkhn7,"I'm buying in, but only into a handful of companies (I think I have like 8 companies right now) that I think will do well 1-2 years from now. I'm also buying small chunks of shares, with the full expectation that the price could keep sinking, so I am, technically, DCA'ing in.

For many parts of the market, we're in month 5 of a bear market / correction. I'm buying companies that I think will continue to have strong cash flows, even with inflation head winds, which is how I have such a small list of stocks.

Timing the bottom is just as difficult to time as the top, so the only thing I'm considering right now is if the price will be higher next February. For good companies with consistent and growing cash flows, the answer will very likely be 'yes'. 

It's now more important to understand the value of what you're holding. I could have been tempted to jump out of my OSTK leaps while the price just went from $50, down to $38, but earnings came out stellar and the price went right back up to the $40s. One year price target on this stock is over $100, and it has a P/E of like 5. So I don't care about the price action this month, because I think by September my LEAPS are going to be printing hard.

I think there are a lot of scary macro economic numbers out there, but people calling for crashes are just wishful thinking. They won't have a chance to buy AMZN or GOOG at $1000. AAPL isn't going down to $60. I'm not even sure TSLA will get back down to $600. It's not a question of multiples; the cash flows justify their current valuations, even under conservative multiples and projections.

I think very speculative stocks can and will continue to get crushed, but there are many companies out there that are surprisingly good deals right now after months of selling off, while pulling in great profits. Saying ""historically, S&P should be at 13 P/E"" is completely meaningless. That data comes from a time of slower growth rates and fewer globally scaled mega-corporations.

What’s your opinions on here?,szkhn7,"If the financials check out and they’re a good company but the stock keeps dipping, don’t focus as much on the stock price. A lot of times I see with investors is they’re willing to go along with these companies that have terrible financials but are excellent pump and dumps. If you believe in the company and the financials tell a good story then stick to it. Right now I’m in a company ticker YCBD. Their stock price has taken a plunder for the worse. However, they have great products and the financials line up as far as debt to equity and cash on hand. If they were plundered in debt and outstanding liabilities I’d say no way I’m a listen to everyone and find my exit position but if the financials and quality of products/services line up I tune out the noise, wait until I get some purchasing power, and load up. You also have to have a strategy of will I invest in a company short term or long term as well. As I’ve gotten better I like playing options short term but again if good company I’m looking long term and even if the stock drove down to a penny and the boxes check I’m licking my chops buying more.

Personally, I think GOOGL has the biggest moat in the FAANG - between its search, YouTube, mobile OS duopoly with Apple, and one of the big three in the cloud space. Plus, obviously, massive advertising revenue. It’s heavily in favour on Reddit at present as it crushed earnings, and I like how many different verticals they’re trying to get into… though they’ve often fallen flat on innovations. Either way, it’s a monster and will continue growing like one. The stock split will also likely drive up the share price.

Sentiment is incredibly negative on FB at present, and it’s always been considered like a vice stock. The Metaverse isn’t something I’m totally sold on, though a lot of large companies are throwing R&D budgets at it. If it comes off, FB will be well-positioned. With it as beaten down as it is, I think there’s a lot of upside. The headwinds of Apple and Google’s advertising changes remain, but FB continues to turn massive profits. 

Declining active users on the FB platform itself is heralded as the end of days for the company, but… I don’t see it. While people do move on to newer platforms, FB itself has been incredibly sticky as a social media platform. Likewise, Instagram remains insanely popular. WhatsApp may be harder to monetise, but it’s got a massive, active, user base. FB is also doing well with the Oculus in the VR space. My biggest criticisms are really that they could be doing more to bolster their core business. Reels to compete with TikTok is good, but I’d like to see them capitalise more on the marketplace feature / collaboration with Shopify and similar; rather than having everything quite so focused on the Metaverse.

In short, FB is the riskier play with greater headwinds, but has been oversold to the point it’s got a decent amount of upside potential. If it lands its Metaverse gamble and/or finds a way to recover some of the advertising future earnings to be lost to privacy changes, it could be a really good long hold. GOOGL will likely continue to grow consistently and churn profits. If it builds a moat in any of the various areas they’re focusing R&D money, it will be a very nice upside.",105,2022-02-19 23:38:39
stocks,5 year bet - GOOG or FB,swmx1b,"Easy call is GOOG, also the one with a much high sentiment right now. 

FB on the other hand has room for being a turn around trade, we never know when they might pivot their business model again or if/when investor confidence in the meta verse increases. I see GOOG as a more sure bet but I can definitely see a world in which FB severely outperforms GOOG and the market.",20,2022-02-20 00:05:42

stocks,5 year bet - GOOG or FB,swmx1b,"Hard call to make, and I believe it’ll come down to which stock enjoys the higher multiple on its earnings. I expect them both to perform well over the next 5 years. 

FB has a lot of headwinds but you can make the argument that they are near-term. Once resolved FB will appreciate in value both from multiple expansion as investors feel more confident in their business model as well as higher earnings. Near-term hiccups include Apple’s IDFA policy which is costing FB approx. $10B/year (maybe more), and transition to reels which has a lower monetization rate than feed. Tiktok is a scary competitor and FB hasn’t faced a rival this serious since inception. My personal theory is Tiktok can be positive for Facebook over the long-term. It’ll force Facebook to evolve into a better company, and for the moment I believe anti-trust cases are off the table which was previously a dark cloud over them. 

Google is free from these issues and if they were similar in price I’d go all in on Google. The lack of uncertainty ahead of the company is reflected in their higher multiple and could be the reason Facebook appreciates more over the next 5 years. If you want a stock that will likely give above-market returns without additional volatility, I’d go with Google. If you do not mind the volatility and understand Facebook is suffering from terrible sentiment, the current price for shares is very attractive.

stocks,5 year bet - GOOG or FB,swmx1b,"I’m a little confused that so many people have HOT takes re: the metaverse concept this soon. You won’t give zuckerberg even a little benefit of the doubt? Even though he’s thought about this way harder and with way more data than you? Aight.

public markets have always grossly undervalued Facebook. If it weren’t so big $fb would be the textbook LBO target (huge cash flows, grossly undervalued, very minimal capex, still robust growth, industry leadership, optionality, etc).

Imagine if zuckerberg bought back all the shares for a laughable 14x forward earnings (vs 23x for the s&p) and turned Facebook into a personal atm that deposits massive quarterly dividends directly into his checking account. And kept publishing earnings just to make public investors hate themselves. This is the sort of shit I dream of doing to my imagined haters.

People confidently mocked Facebook for paying $700 million for Instagram back in 2012. Now Instagram alone would fetch at least $350 billion in an m&a process. If in 10 years Facebook turns metaverse into a cash cow free from the control of Apple/Google, a lot of people are going to look really goddamn stupid.

You're not a day trader, so why would you expect to generate daily/weekly/monthly income.

You have 3 options:
Take your losses and quit investing (worst option). Your money isn't lost until you sell. Or the company goes bankrupt. 

If you're convinced what you invested in will grow and profit with time, then shut your app, walk away, and check it once a month. Or once a quarter. Give yourself 5 years and see if what you invested in actually grows. That money you spent is gone. You can let it grow and multiply, or you can fret about it, but your emotions won't change the market. 

Some of companies you added to are very good. You also invested in the S&P twice (VOO and SPY), but whatever.

Third option is down the middle of the other two. Cut your losses, you're probably bad at stock picking. Take everything and add it all to an index like VOO or SPY, or VTI. Then wait 5 years.

Your current holdings are totally reasonable. SPY and VOO is redundant.

If I were you, I'd take it on the chin and accept the loss. If you feel like you still want to invest then maybe consider a robo-adviser or a financial planner.

Your entire decision making process has been to lean on others; 3 examples below.

&#x200B;

1)You shouldn't have followed your friends advice blindly on investing into hype.

2)You shouldn't have followed /r/stocks trend of investing into indexs and dividends blindly.

3)You shouldn't be posting on reddit for advice when the answers should have been clear from before you even entered those positions.

\-What was your plan? What was your take profit level? What is your time horizon? What is your stop loss? What is your plan for draw downs? Where are the broken support levels you'd consider selling? What kind of trend are you looking for? Which macro economic factors will lead you to re-evaluate, and so on.

You didn't do the required amount of diligence to feel confident in your trades, and you didn't have plans for any downside risk. You shouldn't be investing, but you can reconcile and learn.",1,2022-02-20 18:21:55

Personally I took the leftover money and threw it in to big blue chip growth like AAPL and AMD and it mostly counteracted some of the dumber choices I made. Apple went from $100ish to $175, AMD I sold some after going from $75 to $116.

Managing your own portfolio is not easy and you should approach it with the expectation that you need to learn how to do it. If you are not prepared to do it, put your money elsewhere (real estate, mutual funds) or DCA into a broad market ETF. 

If you are prepared to learn a bit, you first need to figure out the approach you want to take - passive index investing, dividend yield stocks, buy and hold individual growth stocks, value or growth individual stock picking, swing trading, etc. It does not seem you have done that yet.  

First off, forget about your first 25% loss - you had no clue what you were doing, that money is gone. As to your current portfolio, you had rotten luck with the entry points but some of the picks are not bad (GS, JPM, WM), the rest I'm not sure about. I'm saying this because in my view, we are heading into an inflationary/rate hikes period and as such, I'd want to be long commodities, financials and consumer staples, so WM, GS, JPM might be ok.

However, it seems the market may not be done bottoming out yet so I'd hold off making any purchases just yet, maybe even short the indexes until we get the bottom in. We are still in the damage limitation. So I'm not sure about SPY, VOO; perhaps cash might be better. About FB - I'm not sure FB is done dropping, the issues they are facing may be longer term.   

How long to make your loss back? If you go with indexing strategies, I would guess around 5 years (assume around 10% return per year). If you learn to do active investing successfully, you can probably make it back in a couple of years. If you stick with your current portfolio - I'd guess between 3-5 years. 

Good luck. And remember, this advice is worth exactly what you paid for it :)",1,2022-02-20 20:15:35

Dude, if you don't know not to sell when you're down, that you don't lose money till you sell, then I don't know what to tell you. I'm not sure you should be investing in individual stocks if you get worried enough to sell your stocks at a loss.

I'm a motley fool subscriber, and have bought a lot of their recommendations, and LOTS of them are down 40% to 60% over the last year (some of them are up, and up big). But I'm in my early thirties - I don't need to sell those stocks for another 20 years at least. and I have a fair amount of dividend stocks too. So I'm not worried. 

There's still a decent thesis in a lot of Cathy Wood stocks, over the long term, 5 to 15 years or more. all those heavy growth stocks are going to fluctuate wildly, as they're doing now. if you're the type that gets worried about that, then those are not the stocks you should invest in. there's no shame in that. people just have different temperaments. stocks are not for every temperament.
if you are the type that gets worried about stocks being down, then I would echo the advice of a lot of other people here, and say just don't invest in individual stocks, only do broad market index funds. and don't check them very often.",1,2022-02-21 01:55:00

Account size matters. Compare your losses to your annual income. Since you are new at this, these losses are probably no big deal in the long run. If you really need to spend the money this year, then stocks are too risky for you. If you don't really need to spend it, then you aren't ""screwed"". Good quality stocks will recover over time. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Don't quit your day job, and continue to invest spare cash from your paycheck. 

Learn about the whole market, not just tech and trendy stocks. Serious long term investors make bank on boring blue chip stocks and dividend kings as well as megacap FAANG stocks. 

Buy stocks that you are truly confident in, after doing all of the research you can withstand. Set a buy price and stick to it. Think about what you will do if a stock price drops, before you buy it, and stick to your plan without fail. In general, buy quality and don't sell unless you really need the money now. 

People will always need food, water, shelter,  energy, transportation, consumer staples, and communications. Everyone knows this, so the risks and returns are lower but more consistent in these areas. Invest in well-established companies in these sectors and you will be fine.",1,2022-02-21 05:19:55

The whole worry with an invasion was about inflationary impacts primarily because of potentially soaring oil/energy prices. If that doesn’t happen, then part of the recent selloff is unjustified and we should revert higher.

stocks,I believe stocks will rally because sanctions were shit,t0omba,"WinRAR is russian? Wow. I guess one never stops learning.

I've been downvoted across many subs for basically saying that russians have got the upper hand here. I was wrong on invasion because then youre looking at a 40+ million people country that would be insanely difficult to occupy. What will Putin do when Ukraine surrenders,  I have no idea.

However, despite the invasion i still believe they have the upper hand: 

1. The current sanctions mean jack

2. Russians picked the time of invasion when there is a global energy crunch and massive inflation - no one is even considering placing an embargo on russian exports like oil and gas that are crirical to global economy. They also make a ton of aluminum, which you guessed correctly, is in huge demand now as well.

3. Last option for west to implement is removing Russia from SWIFT, which some would claim would be devastating. There's some conflicting info here, as supposedly Russia only accounted for 1.5% of all SWIFT transactions. Regardless, if the west decides to go that route, then Russia has an entire hand of dick moves they can pull off, one of them being dropping the petrodollar. If that happened, we'd be screwed, because next country in line to drop that would be china and they buy every drop of oil and gas from them.

In very few other segments of the market do you get such explosive growth (unless your looking at penny stocks which has it’s own set of minefields)

The challenge of biotech is you have to buy pre phase 3 and the bigger the addressable market the better.  Then, You need the phase 3 trials to go right.  Be prepared for -25, -50 or even -75% down if phase 3 doesn’t go well.  I don’t have any names that i am comfortable with right now in this segment. 

The challenge of ev is most of the names are already wildly over priced and the juice is mostly the gone in the end car manufacturers (Tesla, Rivian, etc).  However in the battery technology sub sector i think there is definitely 10x potential along with a ton of risk!  I am going with $QS (quantum scape) and $SLDP (solid power) and if you really want juice, the $SLDPW Dec 2026 warrants.

Also i believe off the top of my head (still drunk). All but AREC have strong balance sheets and cashflow. Pls correct me if I’m wrong, so even if market crash comes soon they will be fine. GRPN is def my favourite.",2,2022-02-21 22:47:48

stocks,What stock do you think could be a possible tenbagger?,sy5vcp,"I'm going to put forward a couple that I like;

OPRA, Opera Ltd - market cap of 766m - this company makes a web browser for desktop and mobile. Massive growth in user base, as well as revenues from multiple streams every quarter. Fundamentals look fantastic. They also have strategic investments that are very discounted on their books.

Opera does make a few additional products, and you can see them all on their website.

ABST - Absolute Software - market cap of 467m - this company deals in self-healing endpoint security. They make a few other products and have been making acquisitions to bolster their portfolio. Debt levels look bad for this company, but the revenue growth has been very nice. In the last two quarters, revenue was up 53% and 63% YOY. 

Personally, I have 150 shares of ABST, and as of tomorrow, I'll have between 130 and 200 shares of OPRA. I'll definitely continue to add to these positions, however, they are relatively small positions in my portfolio at this time.

I knew it would be a big winner over 3-5 years. Never expected the run to be so fast.

This is the kind of company you need to find: real business that has been ignored/thrown out for some odd reason. These opportunities are extremely rare.

- Keep the business they have.
- Retake a bit of CPU business from AMD.
- Expand into GPUs and foundry services (underway).
- Inflation.
- Excess earnings -> buybacks or reinvested dividends.

---> should lead to a 2x growth in earnings/share over the next 5 years.

Re-rating from PER 9 currently to a PER similar to AMD/NVIDIA if they're successful with GPU line. (Those are on PERs 48-80, even after the recent nasdaq decline)

2-3x multiplied by 5-8x is 10x-24x.

In fairness, AMD and NVIDIA do not deserve those sky high price/earnings ratios. But if Intel comes back into favour and a new bubble forms in 5 years, that would be what I'd expect. The dotcom bubble for Intel in 2000 is an interesting point of comparison.",1,2022-02-22 03:45:33

stocks,Berkshire Hathaway?,szgswk,"I love BRK.B, Valuation may be a little high but just know its never going to be ""low"" since A) Warren has way to much exposure and B) they have no problem buying back stock (if fact they have open share repurchase agreements where they execute pretty much anytime the P/B drops below 1.2). But I'd be wary to say they are ""40% apple"" - Apple is ~40% of their PUBLIC portfolio, but that is now where close to their overall size. To compare, their public portfolio is ~$340b, their Apple stake is ~$149.1b and they have cash of $149.2b...all of these are Q3 21 numbers as they haven't released their 10k yet and I'm not updating my spreadsheets currently, but you can see that Apple is very much not ""40%"" of the company. 

Now someone will likely come on and say ""part of that cash is the insurance float"" which is true, so its not all investable - but that brings up another point  none of those numbers above include the value of Geico or Benjamin Moore or BNSF or Netjets or or or....I could genuinely go on for days. Berkshire's public portfolio is only a piece of the pie, a large piece, but still only a piece.

All that said, BRK B is by far my favorite company and largest personal holding. I think its a bit pricey now, but I will be buying any (and all) dips.

For example, Apple pays corporate taxes on its profits, but then when Berkshire makes profit on Apples profits, they pay corporate taxes on those profits, and lastly, you as a taxpayer pay taxes on your capital gains on Berkshire. There's a reason very few C-Corps invest directly in marketable securities, it isn't tax efficient even with the credits that do exist.

For a wealthy investor in the 37% tax bracket, Berkshire might be worth it since they're a diversified company that pays no dividends, but for the average joe I don't think its worth investing in them directly.

There is a tendency of an investor to sell a good stock (the winner) too early, and hold stocks that are down (the losser) too long. When a positive frame is presented to the investors, they are more likely to avoid risks; and when the negative frame is presented, they are more likely to seek risks.

The investors always looks at the picture from an angle that presents gain, which explains why very few consider opportunity losses as long as their portfolio is green.

In trying times such as the Financial Crisis of 2008 and the Covid-19 pandemic crash, it's easy to serve up, or ""frame,"" examples that compare the current environment to something ominous from the past, such as the Great Depression.",6,2022-02-20 21:28:10
stocks,List of cognitive biases to be aware off when investing.,sx6vvx,">**Dunning-Kruger Effect:** The less you know, the more confident you are. The more you know, the less confident you are. You see this with seasoned investors vs newbies all the time.

fwiw, this isn't the Dunning-Kruger effect.  It's called the [Overconfidence Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overconfidence_effect).  If you read the original DK Effect study, it shows that students who got better grades were more confident and students who got worse grades were less confident.  The Dunning-Kruger Effect is that people who are confident should be more confident and people who are less confident should be less confident.  Here is the real DK Effect: https://flatearth.ws/t/cognitive-bias and https://www.quora.com/Isn-t-it-true-that-we-all-have-cognitive-biases-so-therefore-all-suffer-from-the-Dunning-Kruger-effect

If you're trading the market, you're confident, otherwise why would you do it?  So the bias here is being overly confident when you should be less confident until you learn from first hand experience to show yourself you know what you're doing.

Gotta love Wikipedia on this one, ""Overconfidence has been called the most ""pervasive and potentially catastrophic"" of all the cognitive biases to which human beings fall victim.[29] It has been blamed for lawsuits, strikes, wars, and stock market bubbles and crashes. ""

>**Confirmation Bias:** oh look this post is exactly what I was thinking it must be right

This is imo the second biggest bias traders face.  I know this because I can tell people the answers all day, even with proof, and the only people that will listen are the ones that I confirm their bias.  Then when I change gears as needed, those people who listened to me and got benefit from me no longer will listen to me while others will.  I guarantee you this one is at the top of the list.

>**Gambler’s Fallacy:** We think future possibilities are affected by past events. Technical analysis anyone?

This one hits closest to the worst fallacy new traders and investors bump into.  Technically the market is not a random walk, so gambler's fallacy is technically incorrect here.  I'm sure there is a proper name for the actual fallacy, but in investment and trading circles it's called ""chasing"".

How the bias works is a new trader will look at a chart and base their trades off of it.  If they're a bit more sophisticated they might rely on a backtest.  You often hear, ""Past performance does not predict future results.""  You can see it in the last 2 years where all of these growth stocks new investors loved got massively inflated, why?  Because in a stock chart it looked good.

Now that the market has been moving downwards for a month+ and we're seeing retail traders deleverage, reduce margin, some get out of the market.  Many have huge losses, and so again the chart is downward, so it must continue to go downward right?  Wrong!

And then some go for a round two of this bias.  They become contrarians.  If it goes down it must go up, if it goes up it must go down.  Wrong again!  Same bias, just flipped.

This bias is the one probably 99.99% of new traders and investors fall for.  This harms traders, but if one zooms out on a logarithmic decade long view of S&P it makes VOO look *really* good, so investors pile into index funds, which ends up working out for them, so this fallacy, while harmful, works out for some people ironically.

I used to tell people, ""Learn to trade without using a chart."" but no one got it, so I stopped saying that years ago.",7,2022-02-21 02:36:47

2. Research about how to beat the indices - The (good) literature here is very, very clear and almost unanimous.  Beating the market is very doable for the average investor and in some cases, they have huge advantages over professionally managed funds.

stocks,How to filter out all the bullshit noise as a normal investor.,sxuaan,"So far, ""don't fight the Fed"" is holding up very well. In November 21, the fed announced that it would begin tapering asset purchases in December. They did and have since doubled the rate of taper and stated that they will begin raising interest rates in March, once the taper is complete. So far, they've stuck to their word on this.

Many market participants believe the fed will taper and perhaps even raise rates, but will then bail and turn the money hose back on if the market starts to tank. Recent episodes (over the last decade) did go this way. Personally, I believe that ""this time is different"".

The evidence for this is the rising inflation as reported in the [CPI](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=LWoe), PCE, PPI and other metrics. We have the highest inflation since the 1970's, by some measures. 

If you then believe that the fed will actually do its job and fight inflation, the least you would suspect is that they will raise interest rates a decent amount through several rate hikes over at least the next year or two. If rates then continue to rise past maybe 3 or 4 percent, as was necessary with high inflation in the 70's and 80's, equity valuations will continue to fall (stonks will go down). Or, if the fed surprises the market with ""excessive"" tightening measures, it is presumed this would also potentially cause a significant crash.

Without the easy money support, you then fall back on actual fundamentals and valuations based on financial performance. The S&P 500 [CAPE](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe) ratio (currently 35.59) has only ever been higher during the dotcom bubble. The historical average is around 17.

So my perception is that the bull run you described from the last 8 years was part of the low interest / excessive liquidity mayhem provided by the fed. I believe that era is ending presently due to high inflation. Without the easy money, i believe valuation multiples will continue to collapse. I think if you're buying the S&P at a CAPE of 36, basically your only prayer of profiting in the next decade or so (ignoring ""bear market rallies"" and other temporary events) is if the fed fully reverses their current monetary stance.

On top of that, I read a few books on China’s property sector recently and combining that with the recent developments that have only gotten worse, just that alone will put a drag on global growth. The property sector is ~30% of China’s GDP, which represents an outsized portion of GDP growth across the world.

All of this led me to tilt bearish and I thought there was much more downside risk than upside opportunity, given that rates can literally only go in 1 direction, valuations are stretched, and stimulus is being withdrawn. 

I DCA’d out of most positions in October and have been shorting high multiples since November— and investing in alternatives since December, which all have done surprisingly well.

What is driving the ""potential""? Is it worth what people are paying for it?

Step 2: Do you understand what the company is doing? Does it make sense to you? Does the management seem sound to you? If you can't answer all of these questions, or you don't like the answer to any one of them, forget it

Step 3: If you found a good stock that you understand, is valued appropriately to your standards, has good management and products or services, has the right information you want to see in the quarterly and annual reports, then buy it and leave it alone unless any of the magic points from above have changed to no longer be to your liking.

At a basic level, when there’s optimism in a company there’s a lot of people who want to buy the stock and less people who want to sell it.  So the buyers will outbid each other thus driving the price up (and/or sellers will raise their prices knowing its a sellers market with a lot of potential buyers bidding for what they are selling).  Conversely, when there’s bad news there are more sellers looking to sell than there are buyers so the sellers will theoretically lower their price to secure a seller.",20,2022-02-22 18:19:59

To keep up with demand, me and the other orchards plant more trees, get better irrigation, etc.  Now we have a really good harvest, almost too good.  We've sold so many apples and still have a bunch left over.  Now my price is $0.50 because I'm just trying to get rid of my apples.

Then the house sits there until the seller takes it off the market, or the seller lowers the price, or someone comes in and makes an offer they accept.

When more people are selling than buying, the price gets lower. The people selling are selling for the bid price, so the buyers can start bidding lower, and the sellers have to ask for less when they sell. When the price goes up, there’s more buyers, they have to bid higher to get the stock, and those selling can ask for more.

Price is determined by market participants- if you're asking why stock ABC is not trading at 20$ per share but at 200$, the simplest reason is that there are a million institutions, traders and investors who are willing to pay far more than 20$. The highest price a person is willing to pay for 100 shares of ABC and the lowest price a person is willing to sell 100 shares forms the best bid and offer. 

If you want to sell ABC for 20$ right now, well congrats, you already have a buyer for 200$. That would be the last transaction and the price will reflect 200$.",1,2022-02-22 23:08:17

That said, whether it's a good 5-10 year investment is another story. There are legitimate concerns other fintech and e-commerce players (Shopify being one example) will cut into future revenues. That said, PayPal's venmo is being rolled out on Amazon. Fintech is a difficult sector to gauge right now because of a nebulous competitive landscape. What exactly is it that makes PayPal so special and gives it a competitive advantage other than its current customer base and brand (which is actually pretty important tbh)?

stocks,Will PYPL recover?,sx8mfv,"I tried to catch the knife on Paypal at 180 and had to cut my losses after the earnings report (thank god I bought a protective put). The problem with this stock is that it is transitioning from a growth stock to a value stock. It will be quite a while if ever before they can fetch a growth stock multiple again from Wall Street. Their last earnings report was concerning for investors because it clarified how much their business was slowing, and how much the pandemic, with stay at home and them stimulus checks, really benefited their business artificially. The company said so themselves. It also occurred to me that Paypal is probably the dinosaur in its space now, and is easily disrupted. Online payments, for example, people don’t really use Paypal for that anymore, now that Google/Apple pay exist. Now that the tide is going out, these risks become very stark. The most important aspect to a company to me is the moat. I’m not sure PayPal’s can be that durable.",4,2022-02-21 00:14:45

That's to say it is going to be an extremely low margin sector. And with AAPL getting more involved in the payment processing sector, I believe AAPL has the luxury to use their payments platform as a ""loss leader"" to sell more hardware *edit: and mine more data*. This could compress PYPL margins further.

I currently don't see anything appealing from PYPL in at least the near term.

_Nasdaq peaked on Friday March 10, 2000._

The initial trigger is attributed to news on Monday March 13, 2000 that Japan had once again entered a recession, this triggered a global sell off that disproportionately affected tech stocks.

Yahoo! And eBay ending merge talks on March 15, 2000 exacerbated the fall.

Then further exacerbated by Barron’s March 20, 2000 featured article titled “Burning Up; Warning: Internet companies are running out of cash — fast.” This article is considered pivotal in the bust and an excellent piece of journalism that laid out the reality of the market and where things were headed. I recommend reading it.

Then on April 3, 2000 Microsoft is found guilty of monopolization and tying in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, which further exacerbated negativity.

Then the internet companies’ earnings started to roll out which 100% confirmed Barron’s report.

Then, a few months later, the bankruptcies started.

Imagine like tech in 2000 was 95% todays SPACS, 5% actual real companies. The Nasdaq was mostly composed of fraudulent companies, no growth, no revenues, some didn’t even have products, companies where +90% of their expenses went into exuberant marketing campaigns.

This is probably going to be a long post.

So how the internet worked in the 90s was businesses without business.  There was no such thing as a ""secure transaction"" so the companies that did do ecommerce (like Amazon) were really small potatoes because no one trusted internet companies with credit cards.  So what was funding the internet?  Well.... real world companies.  They would pay for advertisers who would give them reach that was too good to be true.

The internet's reach still is too good to be true, but not nearly as much as back then.  The confusion came when old school business didn't understand internet advertising metrics like impressions vs unique views and clickthroughs vs engagement.  Let's say you are scrolling through Reddit and you see an advertisement load up.  You see it, and then you scroll down and see it again.  That's two impressions, but only one unique view.  In the virgin internet advertisers would tell old companies they'd get thousands of views.... which advertisers thought meant unique views... and not impressions.  Similarly you would get paid extra if someone clicked on an advertisement.  But not all clicks are engaging.  Pop ups and forced clicks could cause people to go to websites without actually wanting to... the advertisee would pay the advertiser for something that gave them no value at all.  Of course  geolocation was also another problem, Bob's Plumbing in Vermont has no use for customers in Canada.

CPM in the 90s (the golden age of internet monies) was anywhere from $40-$200 CPM.  CPM stands for ""clicks per mill"" and is the metric for how people get paid.  In modern times the modern platforms go as low as $0.20 CPM to $20 CPM.... which tells you how bad of a crash it was.

So anyway the New York Times published an article just before the crash explaining how the whole of the internet is actually a giant scam that sucks money from the real world (kind of like how most people view NFTs and cryptocurrency) and puts it into a fake world that provides no real value.  CPM rates crashed for just about all websites.

Alan Greenspan rolls around and decides at that point to raise interest rates.  This causes a huge liquidity squeeze on hundreds of websites that have never made a penny and had no path to profitability.... they were just sucking endless investments to keep the pool parties going.

Eventually DotCom company after DotCom company just kept running out of money.  Some of them sold for their patents, but most just faded into obscurity (The website [Pets.com](https://Pets.com) IPOed and nine months later it just died).

1. There were a small group of power stocks that seemed to move forward regardless of what the rest of the market did. Back then we called them the four horsemen (there were 4 'power' stocks). Recently they were (some variation of) FAANG.

2. There were many value/growth comparisons of old school companies vs newer companies. Example, recently Rivian was valued at more than Ford motor, even though they had sold only about a dozen automobiles.

3. Newer investors disregarded high PE ratios, claiming that tech companies had much greater growth opportunities than their 'old school' peers, and that old stodgy investors just didn't understand how this new tech stuff worked, and that the older people would be left in the dust while the younger, hipper crowd would be rich in a few short years.

4. CNBC was full of shit back then too. So was FOX and CNN. Cramer was still more entertaining than informative. Motley Fool was still a piece of shit ripoff.

5. Modern society was prepping for collapse. Y2K was a very real scare, that fortunately never amounted to much more than a lot of money spent.

6. The Federal Reserve caused the markets to twitch whenever the chairman spoke. When Greenspan blew his nose, the media predicted how far the market would rise or fall by the color of his hanky. Today the same thing is happening with Powell.",1,2022-02-23 06:57:58

If the economy slows MSFT will still likely hit their earnings growth, whereas JPM won’t. Growth stocks are not only growth stocks because they are growing fast, but because they will grow through damn near everything.

If JPM expectations go back down to 3-5% earnings growth, you’ll pay more for MSFT

1. A lot of short positions on ARKK-type speculative stocks started to be covered when everything tanked premarket. This added buying pressure.
2. Retail sentiment was “buy the dip”, judging by Reddit posts and Youtubers around the same time.
3. These two things together created a bounce, which improved sentiment and lured more people into FOMO.
4. Then Biden announced that Russia was not going to be cut off from Swift, which was the main thing the market was worried about. This caused a further relief rally to build on the preceding.
5. There was some talk that a 50 basis point rate hike in March was less likely, which added to sentiment.

However, every rally we’ve seen recently has gotten sold eventually, if only because a lot of people are underwater and will sell at the opportunities they get. Nasdaq futures are currently down 1%.

stocks,You guys learned nothing from Covid,t042xm,"I've kinda had it with all these people throwing around the term ""MMT"" to describe just any fed action. Printing money =/= MMT. The fed board does not believe in MMT. They do not practice it. The fed is just buying more financial assets than it would usually. It's literally what they've always done they're just doing it more than usual. 

If you actually investigate MMT, you would figure out that the fed is not doing that. If the Federal government was printing money to finance infrastructure, job programs, etc, without issuing debt, that would be MMT. It's not doing that. If the federal government was using taxation as the main way of controlling inflation, that would be MMT. Its not doing that. 

QE is not MMT; it's just extremely aggressive classic monetary theory. You can criticize the fed, just don't make stuff up and say they're doing MMT.",1,2022-02-24 15:10:09

Nord Stream 1, which goes directly to Germany  via Ukraine from Russia,  provides 35% of Europe's natty gas demand and nearly 100% of German's natty gas demand.  Russia already has pipelines in place to transport Natural Gas and Crude Oil directly to China from Russia so they are not reliant on Europe for demand.  So this potential war like most previous wars is about Energy.  

Biden has threatened sanctions on Russia including suspending Nord Stream 2 if Russia invades Ukraine.  Well that is going to put USA at odds with Germany.  Where is Europe and Germany in particular going to get their Energy?  That Natural Gas is going to have to come from the USA, which will also unfortunately raise Natural Gas prices here.

stocks,Is the stock market being used as a modern battleground?,sw8kax,"A physical war with China will never happen.

The ""war"" will be done through economics, policies, trade, stocks, assets, etc. So if the U.S wants to gain dominancy over China, it needs to use the military, own the means of production/economic power. But China doesn't want a war with the U.S. Also, China doesn't need to acquire Taiwan by 2022, it's a 50-year goal, which isn't about when necessary, it's just going to happen. At least this is how Xi has said it. So there is not going to be a physical war.

The China discount where Chinese stocks are priced less is where some of the war is. Because the U.S. has power over the biggest stock exchanges and financial system. The U.S will use this as leverage in politics with China. Perhaps if China were to bail out the U.S, change the value of the yuan, give better trade, etc, then the U.S would push their financial banking systems or other entities to promote Chinese stocks/assets and promote buying Chinese stocks as an exchange. These are just some of the advantages of owning the means of production. While China may own the physical means of production such as labor. The U.S. is the holder of the reserved currency and all the benefits.

Delisting Chinese stocks would never happen because of how interwoven the U.S and China are. However, the ""China discount"" and anti-Chinese rhetoric can be controlled by the U.S government. So, yes, the stock market is being used as a modern-day battleground.",1,2022-02-20 09:06:57

VT is so diversified that your risks are mainly systemic -- things that affect the global economy in general and global stock markets in particular.  If INTC disappeared tomorrow, the VT would drop 0.26%.  If INTC doubled tomorrow, VT would go up 0.26%

Semiconductor ETF is going to add the risk of things that specifically affect the semiconductor industry -- shortages, supply chain issues, legislation targeting them, what have you.  If INTC disappeared tomorrow, VGT would drop 1.6%.  If INTC doubled tomorrow, VGT would go up 1.6%

INTC is going to add company-specific risks -- that INTC falls farther behind the curve, that AMD eats their lunch, that INTC accountants are cooking the books, etc.  If INTC disappeared tomorrow, you lose 100%.  If INTC doubled tomorrow, you'd make 100%.

Diversification helps mitigate risk -- it doesn't help increase return.  So it's entirely possible that INTC outperforms a sector ETF, which outperforms VT.  So you may be trading return for risk mitigation.  That's fine, just depends on whether that's what you want to do.",4,2022-02-19 21:15:45

\-Doubling down on their fabs (causing high capital expenditure and likely negative free cash flow mid-term), while their processes had one delay after another and TSMC as larger competitor in that space pushes out new processes like a clockwork? If Intel fails to stay competitive, they'll have a big problem

\- That seems to have no real competitive product (against AMDs server products, that capture market share in a fast pace) in the segment having the highest margins until at least 2024?

stocks,Is this investing thought stupid?,swdw4e,"The problem with index funds, as I see it, is that you are highly diversified but have to hope that the markets gain more than they lose every year. Drags on the market and your investment is shot even if your personal picks like Intel are up 30% (FB can be down 40% so you are actually losing money still. Simple example though). Intel is also cheaper than say investing in VT. For a lot of investments the underlying company you actually want is probably to cheaper to own than buying an index",3,2022-02-19 18:55:10

Only issue is if you have an issue with home country bias (If you are a U.S. domiciled) or frame of reference risk.  If so, then stop one spot before that though process and do VTI (U..S. total stock market).

stocks,Is this investing thought stupid?,swdw4e,"Not an answer to your question, but investing in Intel right now is quite risky despite the low PE.

There's no guarantee at all that Intel can regain foundry leadership. If that's the case, Intel's chip design division will have no advantage over other fabless design companies. It will have to compete over architectural superiority with the same transistor density constraints, if using the same foundry (i.e. TSMC)

Major chip re-design takes 4-5 years to come to fruition and it can flop. So it really comes down to who's design will flop. AMD bulldozer is one example and I think Intel also had a flop before but made it up with their foundry node superiority. 

So if anyone invest in Intel, I would invest it purely on the valuation of its foundry business, plus some heavy discount on its chip business to account for the fact that Intel may never regain technological leadership in its chips. Right now it's business inertia and large supply capacity that's keeping AMD in check.",1,2022-02-19 22:27:04
stocks,Is this investing thought stupid?,swdw4e,"Intel still making the same 14 Nano node since 2013 while Taiwan Semi and Samsung are now 5 nano node.

In other words, INTC has fallen significantly behind its competition and its share price decline shows it.  That dividend yield is so high because the share price fell, same for the low PE.

In my opinion, with how much volatility the market has, and the precaious competitive position of INTC, you'd be better off dollar cost averaging in to a number of different companies or buying a semiconductor ETF.

Definitely dollar cost average in over a period of weeks. I've made the mistake and bought great companies at what I thought was a great price only to have the price decline further and not have the capital to average down at the time.

As for global total market vs semis - global market will grow but will it grow as fast as the semiconductor industry? Probably not.

In regards to Intel, specifically, it could be a bargain at prices now, it could not be. Intel is behind the curve right now and must play catch up. It’s unloading a lot of capex  into doing just that but actually succeeding is another story - they’ve tried before to catch up with ASML and failed. Advancement in the semi space is not only incredibly difficult because the the sophistication of tech needed, it’s also very expensive, making misses costly, potentially devastating.

stocks,Are you guys buying now? Why/why not?,svw5ju,"What worries me about technology stocks right now is that AAPL is basically at ATHs and I don't see how we can have a recovery on the NASDAQ if AAPL is trading at ATHs. Either AAPL's multiple will need to expand significantly as NASDAQ names recover or AAPL will need to sit out of any recovery. Neither of these seem to make much sense to me.

I'm also worried about how this sell-off has played out so far. Around the middle of last year low quality growth stocks started to sell off while higher quality growth stocks like SHOP, NVDA, NET, etc continued to perform well. Then towards the end of the year higher quality growth stocks started to sell off too, while large caps and lower PE stocks remained fairly unaffected. Then towards the middle of January even larger stocks, perhaps broadly those with less investor conviction started to sell off (FB, NFLX, PYPL, etc) but stocks like AAPL and MSFT which are seen as relatively safe remained fairly unaffected. Over the last couple of weeks we've seen GOOG and MSFT begin to fall again despite great earnings and it's starting to look like AAPL might also be slowly following.

Over the course of the last year investor sentiment has turned progressively more negative as investors have been fleeing lower quality to safety, but what happens when the safety trades come under pressure too?

I've brought this up a few times now, but in 2018 when the FED put balance sheet reduction on auto-pilot the reaction was very different. Everything sold off. I keep seeing people try to justify why great stocks like NFLX and FB should see such huge multiple contractions because of slight earnings misses and rate increases, and why AAPL should be fine trading at a 30 PE. This narrative makes no sense and if this if these trends continue stocks like AAPL are next to fall and if that happens it's going to be a blood bath for everything like it was in 2018. Everything is going to drop 20-30% and lower value, higher PE names will be hit even harder.

I was quite constructive a month ago, but I don't like the setup of this sell-off anymore. Given the risks we're facing the fact the broader market hasn't really sold off yet is odd.

Another thing to note is that the valuation of the overall market just isn't that attractive given where rates could head. Normally you would want to see markets overreact to the downside before buying, but this sell-off has been extremely orderly so far. If the 10y goes to 2.5%, which is totally possible, we need at least another 10% down on the S&P500 and likely 15%+ on the NASDAQ. And again, really you would want to see a drop closer to 20% on the S&P500 from these levels to be confident the market has overreacted enough.

The VIX is also below 30. When you have moves as extreme as those we've been seeing you really want the VIX to spike sharply over 30 to signal the pain is done. At this point I don't even think a 35 on the VIX would be enough. I'd want to see at least 40 which is still a long ways off.

I wouldn't suggest not buying here, but I would be careful about what you buy. I would look for stocks with some margin of safety for now, then look to rotate into riskier names either as the market continues to fall to more oversold levels or as risks ease. I mean, is there even a catalyst for a recovery at this point? If rates are increasing why would stocks recover to previous valuations? They could only rally if valuations are oversold and they're not.",1,2022-02-20 01:58:07

stocks,Here's why I'm Bearish,sznhwu,"Inflation is the big key here. And likely to push the US into recession if things to not improve real soon. The Fed is hilariously behind the curve on inflation, they have really fucked up. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is likely to make inflation in energy worse. Energy affects everything. It makes manufacturing more costly, keeping the lights on and heat running more costly, crimps consumer spending, increases transportation costs, which increases the cost of everything. And just generally puts people in a foul mood.

Maybe we get lucky here and a slow and steady Fed tightening tamps inflation down. But my sense is they are too late and not aggressive enough. Consider the fact that the Fed, right now, is still doing QE. It's insanity.

That's why I'm bearish. That and of course extreme over valuation of equities. I think people who are bullish here are drastically underappreciating the impact inflation, and what will have to be aggressive Fed tightening, will have on equity values.",42,2022-02-23 23:16:44

stocks,Here's why I'm Bearish,sznhwu,"If your outlook is pessimistic that's consistent with the broad information available through mainstream papers and websites, even without looking at the numbers.

There are a couple of variables to consider:

- we got rate hikes, are those very bad? in the past when rate hikes happened they mostly blew up the market in the 2 weeks prior and 2 weeks after they happened. on a 6-month timescale they're not as relevant.

- consumer spending: middle class is hurting but when have they not? 1950s most likely. Has the rate of buying iPhones lowered? Not according to Apple's sales figures: record levels for the latest models. keep in mind iPhones sell worldwide, not just in the US, and plenty of folks are willing to skip buying clothes or cars or other knick-nacks to put together 1-2k$ and buy that iPhone.

- inflation is what demands the rate hikes. if those are raised enough, inflation *should* slowly go away - but of course that's not nearly the big picture: companies use this excuse to pump prices like never before. most have had 4 price hikes in 2021 and planned 3-4 for 2022.

- Most of this nonsense was caused by the pandemic. If that goes away in March, April (most European countries picked March to end all restrictions) you will see a boom you haven't seen before in spending and economic output which will shine through q3 figures hard.

What I can't figure out is what the hell the ruling class want to accomplish with Russia humping Ukraine - but it's definitely beyond just Putin pining for the USSR.

stocks,Here's why I'm Bearish,sznhwu,"I am not exactly a bull as I added to $GOLD and made it my largest position around January and have half of my portfolio in Oil & Gas, Commodities, and Gold; however here's my take on your points.

1 - We will get 4 rate hikes tops.  There maybe a 50 bps hike instead of 25 bps hike to shock the market.  The Fed and J-Pow are jawboning like hell to make the markets think they will have 7 or more rate hikes hoping the market does the work for them.

2 - Yes unemployment numbers are a lagging indicator.  You maybe right here.

3 - Wage inflation this last year has indeed helped the lower class and blue collar workers more than anytime since I have entered the workforce in the late 90s.  This is going to keep pressure on higher inflation as Joe 6 pack can actually still afford that 6 pack of beer after his shift due to his raise higher this year.

4 - Yes the base effect will start in March numbers so the rate of inflation MOM and YOY will be closer to 4% compared to 7.5%.  Supply chains will ease but they were half of the problem.  The other half was the Fed and government increasing the money supply since Covid.

5 - I completely agree.  Biden will do everything to lower inflation expectations even if that means crashing the stock market.  Less than half of Americans own stocks, everyone can vote.  And the more pissed off people get the more likely they are apt to vote and inflation hurts the lower class the most.

6 - I agree that many valuations are still high.  I am not running to dump my entire savings into the market tomorrow; but I will DCA into cheaper valuation stocks monthly at my planned monthly amount set aside for investing every month.",1,2022-02-24 01:48:33

stocks,Here's why I'm Bearish,sznhwu,"> Don't even get me started on valuations. I know your growth stocks are down 50-80% bust just look at S&P valuations vs. historicals (it's not apples to apples but hard to say S&P is cheap)

I think this is the most important part. For a while now markets have become very comfortable with high market PE multiples. I remember first talking about this around Jan 2020 after the market rallied through 2019. It was clear that the pre-2018 market multiple probably no longer applied given the fact everyone knew a FED put would save the market whenever we got into trouble.

We can't rely on a FED put anymore so in addition to pricing in rate hikes we also have to discount the fact we no longer have a FED put. If you do that it seems market valuations are probably still quite high. That said, I actually think we're trading somewhere around the upper end of fair value right now, but given the various uncertainties and fear in the market we probably still need to go lower before we bottom.

Also, I wouldn't underestimate the Ukraine/Russia risk and I think this is largely what the market is pricing in now. Putin's speech seemed far more unhinged than usual. The Ukraine situation is obviously something he's been thinking about for a long time and he clearly has very strong, even emotional thoughts about it. The only good thing about the cold war was that both sides had mostly rational leaders. Thankfully Trump is no longer in power, because who knows what he would be doing right now if he was, but this is the problem with irrational unhinged leaders is that you can't predict what they're going to do next. I keep hearing people say he it wouldn't make sense for Putin to authorise a full invasion of Ukraine, but this clearly isn't about what makes senses. For Putin this is about settling a grief he has had with the West and NATO for decades. At the risk of invoking Godwin's law here, Hitler's invasion of Poland was similar in the fact it was emotionally motivated. I guess what I'm saying is that I wouldn't bet on this being the end of the situation in Ukraine. Things could quite easily get a lot worse and if you want evidence of how fast things can escalate we should remember how just two months ago this risk was on nobodies radar.",-1,2022-02-23 21:01:22

They aren’t bad companies, as a matter of fact they are amazing. But the price is astronomical nosebleed. So the company will do well, but the stock won’t. 

GOOG/MSFT is fair value to kinda undervalued based on their position and growth rate vs P/E. It’s the most efficient when it comes to growth vs price youre going to pay for them.

NVDA is expensive, AMD is GARP (growth at a reasonable price), unity is speculative, will need to see if come down or prove it’s explosive growth rate. No view on servicenow or Crowdstrike.

stocks,Recommendation for tech stocks,swh79m,Some of those stocks are good choices but are relatively overvalued when compared to Chinese/foreign tech stocks. AMC/NVIDIA/GOOGLE/MICROSOFT seem like good choices over long periods of time if you're stuck on overvalued American tech. But I do think over time a few of these companies reliant on Chinese customers will see a decline in quarterly earnings over time. It will probably start to be priced into the actual when a stronger trend is more defined. This is due to an increase in local competition starting to rival or offer even more outside of the U.S market. I would be mindful of this if this is a long term hold.,0,2022-02-20 00:21:48

stocks,$DKNG + $ARKK - Cathie Woods has LOST IT!!,svvlmo,"The extreme confidence in the fact that Cathie Woods is wrong is very reminiscent of her call on TSLA a few years back.

Two points:

* Part of Cathie Woods' advantage is her ability to make ""crazy"" contrarian calls. When everyone universally believes something is a bad trade you can bet that trade is generally going to be miss-priced considerably. This is why legendary investors advise buying into fear and selling greed. When fear is high assets are generally mispriced to the downside, and when investors are overly confident assets are generally mispriced to the upside. Now, investors like Buffett and Benjamin Graham would probably advise you buy and hold blue-chip companies with low earnings multiples during these periods, but Cathie invests in growth tech and right now growth tech is historically cheap and universally hated. If there was ever an incredible buying opportunity for these stocks in the last several years, it's probably now. Why? Because now seems to be the absolute worst time to go all in on growth tech. Cathie Wood for all her flaws is the only investor in the market right now with the balls to actually disagree with the sentiment and buy. This is precisely why she won so big in 2020-2021. When everyone thought TSLA was going bankrupt Cathie Wood was getting mocked for saying it was going to $4000.

* Secondly, I really don't think it makes much sense to judge Cathie Wood's performance on a year-by-year basis. She clearly doesn't give a crap about what happens in those kinds of time frames so if she's not investing for returns this year, why judge her on them? The reason I'm pointing this out is because it's entirely possible inflation concerns are gone by the end of the year and the FED begins to ease their hawkish stance. If we're currently overestimating how high inflation will be for the duration of 2022 and then how high it will remain in the years to follow it's possible this whole rotation into value has been an overreaction. Perhaps the FED won't be as aggressive as the market fears and perhaps growth stocks shouldn't be trading at their lowest valuations in years and will actually recover quite well over the next 2-3 years. From 2021-2025 she may not beat the market, but from 2022-2025 there's certainly a chance she will. What we know for sure is that when everyone was buying ARKK at all time highs last year it was a huge mistake. Now it's down 60% and is so hated that everyone is shorting it there is a chance now is the time to buy.

But who knows. Perhaps this is one of the few times this sub will believe something with high conviction and actually be right. Sentiment towards ARKK on this sub called the top quite well. Lets see if we can do it again for the bottom.",11,2022-02-19 02:45:04

stocks,3M High Debt,sx6gbp,"In general: industrials utilize relatively more debt in order to grow, because their operations are capital-intensive.  E.g. At some point,, for 3M to sell more Post-It Notes, they have to pay for an entire new Post-It Note assembly line.

Specifically, 3M is 72nd percentile among industrial conglomerates for total debt/asset ratio (high).  But it's 100th percentile in EBITD margin, 91st percentile in profit margin, 100th percentile on return on equity, assets, and investment.

So it has slightly more debt than its peers, but it's using the debt efficiently.

I wouldn’t worry about a company’s debt load unless it was over 4 years worth of cash flow.

stocks,3M High Debt,sx6gbp,"Generally speaking, optimal leverage ratio is about 30% of the companies total market value (debt plus market cap). This % depends on the industry and assumes an established company (ie not a startup). Often times the interest paid on debt is (more than) completely offset by the reduction in income taxes due to the deductibility of interest. As such, greater debt actually leads to higher net profit.

The only reason companies don’t go balls to the wall on debt is due to increased risk. If their net earnings drop down to the level of their interest payments (or interest payments rise to the level of earnings), then risk is very high, which then affects their credit ratings from S&P /Moddys (AAA, BB, etc). The lower their rating, the higher their bank loan interest and higher the YTM they need on their bonds. 

Anyway, when you are analyzing debt, the better way to gauge risk is how close net earnings are to their interest payments. If the whole economy tanks (something outside the control of the company), can they manage interest payments with a significant hit to earnings?

Additionally, corporate debt is nothing like personal debt. Yes, the main point is you/the company owes someone money, but the mechanics of them are totally different.",0,2022-02-20 18:02:58

stocks,The Google split,sxlw9w,">So here is the quick rundown for Google. It’s currently 3 classes of shares. Class A ($GOOG), Class B (preferred) and class C (GOOGL). Both class A and class C should have the same value on the markets however the only difference is the Class C ($GOOGL) has 1x value of voting rights. This however is irrelevant as class B owns 10x the voting rights per share and is a majority ownership by Page and Brin. In short, not important.

not to be an ass, but you kinda lose credibility when you are seriously incorrect from the basic structuring of Google.

GOOGL is their class A shares. GOOG is their class C

Class A and class C should NOT have the same value on the market, because of the fact their class A shares (GOOGL) comes with 1x voting rights. (NOT their class C shares)

>This however is irrelevant as class B owns 10x the voting rights per share and is a majority ownership by Page and Brin. In short, not important.

this is correct however. but it doesnt change the fact that GOOGL should come with a small premium. (and it usually does). but for your average investor, your 1x voting rights with 0.0000000000001% ownership in google wont matter. so get the cheaper of the two.


Also, their b class shares are NOT preferred stock. It's just another class of common shares that's structured to have 10x voting power

stocks,How do day traders actually...do things?,sxa0qe,"Day trading strategies are trade secrets of the actual professionals and nobody likes talking about their actual strategies.

I specialize in semiconductor stocks so I research all of the news in that space and try to keep up to date on the risks and issues in the space. My other core competency is banking and finance, but the finance stocks are boring and I don't feel like trading them. 

there is also an element of reading the tea leaves of the market trying to find patterns and humans love patterns even when the pattern doesn't exist. so a lot of the big boys use formulas, sentiment trackers, and other tools to try and weed out false positive information. They don't want to give those tools away so they stay in house and never get out to the realm of educational videos.

Imo.

It's okay if you don't have a lot of money and can't start day trading. Then look to see how you can prepare yourself to start.

Just know what you're getting yourself into and the most important thing is time. Don't let the lucky winners cloud you with confidence bias.

You can get financial news from almost anywhere but when first dipping your toes try to find companies suitable for long term.

Find good companies to trade.

Search with the criteria of long, medium, short.
Try to follow stocks you have some knowledge and basic interest ie. Gaming then video card companies, semi conductors, software companies etc etc
Ie. Activision, ea, Microsoft, amd,  Nvidia.

Learn options as it would help with smaller accounts.

Build your capital slowly but practice with paper money. 

The most important thing is also consistency, whether you're actively trading, always be learning. 

Before all this, get your basic finances in order.

Like almost all things, don't expect to win out of the gate, don't expect to be better and ""talented"" stay humble and open minded.

Be positive yet realistic.

It's a quick way to understand yourself and emotions <-- work on this.

Be a sponge but be your own, find out strategies work for you.

If you find day trading isn't, that's okay too.

It is the opposite of day trading.  Perhaps you can learn how to make money day trading - I haven’t bothered.  It is going to be a rough year for stocks either way.  You should understand the basics of stock valuation before you start putting real money down.  It is easier to learn value investing before trying harder stuff.

This year the market may reprice assets like stocks lower as interest rates go up.  The P/E on the market is high historically so there is risk that stocks will underperform for a while until it is closer to normal ranges.",0,2022-02-21 01:01:47

Baba is my biggest holding. I've doubled down every time it dropped 20%. My current cost basis is 119 per share, and I'm willing to sell most of my stocks to keep buying into this position. Alibaba is extremely well capitalised, China would be stupid to kill the chicken that lays the golden eggs, and interest rates decrease will create a great environment for alibaba to get tailwind. It's currently 33% of my portfolio.
Intc is my second largest position, with 15% and I'm buying more as I get dividends or other revenew sources. I love that they are taking the investment and believe the costs of RnD are investments. Location is also a big part of my bet as keeping every fan in Asia could become a geopolitical hostage case. Having fabs is essential and non negotiable for the current climate.
My third bet is NOK. I'm up 35% but I believe it is more undervalued today than when I started my position at 3.5 a share and at any other point that I've added more shares along the way. Reasonings: very well capitalised; producing strong guidance; optimizing their businesses; good quality patents, great management, and their management is overdelivering guided results, even when their guidance was very ambitions. They lost a big 5g contract but earned many more small ones that made up for it. Revenew is down due to this, but earnings are up anyways.

No on BABA. You dont actually own the company's stock. You own part of a Cayman island holding company acting as a proxy.

stocks,"FB, INTC, and BABA will be top performers in the next 5 years",szuitp,"I am significantly less bullish than you (esp. the bear case numbers) but I more or less agree with you. Some thoughts:

BABA is obviously a great company but also has obvious risks associated with CCP. If the risk is worth it is upto individual investors. Me personally, I am betting some money on it but not a great amount. 

INTC will most likely be able to do a turn-around and it's very fairly valued right now. The question is if the stock will stay stagnant for the next ~2-3 years or not. I decided to buy some earlier this month and will add more in the future if the thesis doesn't change. 

FB okay so I am not particularly enthused about the Metaverse focus (VR definitely has a future but I am not sure about the Meta approach...) but I bought some recently any-ways cause I think the post earnings sell-off was an over-reaction. The company isn't going anywhere soon and if I can sell the stocks with a decent profit whenever there is a rally, I  will be happy.",1,2022-02-24 09:44:58

For me if intel has a bad few years it will be a $50 stock. However I'd give this ~10% chance and think it's more of a $60-$70 right now.

Baba, again your bear case isn't very bearish. If you take into consideration some of the risks then it's clearly not a $200 stock in the worse case scenario.

FB to me is a winner under 200 although I think the metaverse is terrible. Even if you eliminate that, the cash they generate and continued growth I don't see how this isn't above 300 in a year or 2.

I am not involved with them any more but I got my tax form from robinhood and would like to have atleast a TINY bit of insight as for what to expect.

The following is pretty foreign to me but here goes:

Form 1099:

Total proceeds: $12,160

Cost basis: $12,808

Wash sale loss disallowed: $228

Net loss: -$410

This is from the first page. The following pages seem to be the individual transactions listed out.

Can anyone tell me what this means for my taxes?

Russia is invading Ukraine, sure, but we **NOW** know what Biden's response is and the United States is not getting involved (well, we are, just not with direct warfare **at the moment**) and only giving sanctions which will harm Russia. We know inflation fears are down the road.

Why am I saying all this? We have a better understanding of the future due to the actions of what was to come already happening, there will definitely be bearish opportunities in the coming weeks to months, but I can really only see us going up from here long term. 

If you have cash, I would buy in now, and make sure to DCA along the way because we will have more moments of bleeding. For now, I think the reduction of ""unknowns"" is why we are going green.

stocks,"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Technicals Tuesday - Feb 22, 2022",sykdo2,"1. I understand puts are contracts that give the option to exercise and sell a stock at set price. If a stock is $100, and you buy a put strike price of $100 for $5 cost and the stock drops to $50, then you are able to sell the stock for $100 and make a $45 profit. However, in interactive brokers looking at a ""Put Leg"" at a specific stock the P&L is negativley correlated, so in the above scenario instead of making $45 profit, I would lose $45. What am I missing here?
2.  Are shorting costs (when you borrow a stock from a broker) equivilent in cost to a put at the same strike price? Ex: a stock is currently $100. A put option for $100 costs $5. Would a short also cost about $5?",3,2022-02-22 20:46:34

Here is my response to you (whoever you are)


The following is not financial advice. Do your own research and due diligence. Read up about options, calls, selling them and how to close them in time.

Let's say you have about 235 shares.

Option 1: 
 sell 35 shares and book the loss. Down to 200 shares

Sell 4 calls for 190 and buy two calls for 165 for jul15. This will reduce your exit price to 190 in July. Also give you 245 premium. This is called repair strategy. This will also give the stock time to heal but you are giving up on potential gains from investing in other stocks.

Option 2: 
Sell 35 shares. Go down to 200 shares.

Sell 60-90DTE covered calls for strike $190 or thereabouts. A may20 call for $190 is selling for 8.20. if you close the position and make 600 premium, you have brought down your cost basis from 215 to 209 per share. Keep on doing this and keep bringing your cost basis down.

Option 3: 
I personally don't prefer this as this means putting more money in. 

Buy 65 shares at market price so invest another 10k. This will give you total 300 shares and bring your cost basis down to 204. You can then apply either option 1 or 2.

Do a lot of reading. There are strategies to help with your situation",1,2022-02-22 17:07:01

stocks,6 reasons why AAPL isn't a pandemic stock,sybtuk,">Apple is no longer just serving the premium markets. The old saying ""Apple products are overpriced"" is no longer true

Yeah it is. Where do you think their profit margins come from? They're the definition of ""overpriced"".

Then there's bullshit like the 999$ Pro Monitor stand, 19$ Cloth and other overpriced nick-nacks.


You buy a PC to have it configurable and easy to evolve. A MAC is bought once then dumped after its lifecycle is over.

Yeah they might have cheaper stuff now but for those prices you can easily buy something much more powerful. Last time I upgraded my phone I did look at the iPhone SE and I ended up choosing an android from Motorola anyway - had much bigger capacity, screen, better sound and was faster. 

For all things audio there's nothing that is better than sony. Apple's earbuds took off because of branding - like much else they have - celebs were seen wearing them and they were easy to identify regardless of sports regulations forbidding their advertisement.

M1 is legit a great improvement but it has a few catches: 

- programs have to be recompiled so they'll work on the new architecture.

- industry will catch up to it eventually - a time benefit for apple but a cost benefit for everyone else as Apple's R&D spending and gearing up for production balanced it out

- Apple is a pure garbage company when it comes to developers for their platforms: an increasing number of applications were ""stolen"" i.e. copied of ideas and deployed by them without their extra appstore fee they charge everyone else + they'll use stuff like privacy or other seemingly good topics to push against competition for ad revenue or any other sources of revenue. how long will they keep it up until devs get fed up with it and see themselves as targets & guinea pigs? microsoft got slapped for one big case like this in the 90s, Apple so far is staying clear but a reckoning will arrive.

I've been involved with IT all my life and while I commend Apple for their achievements I wouldn't buy any of their products if I can help it - and fortunately for now I can. Microsoft or other industry players copying some of Apple's choices just piss me off on the regular - i hate the hamburger menu dumb-down ui, the constant push of form over function from the boxes and designs and they definitely shot themselves in the foot with the windows 11 look.

They're a good stock to own tho, for now.",1,2022-02-22 14:14:33

In fact, since August 2018, when Apple first hit a $1 trillion value, its stock is up 252%, compared with a market cap increase of about 200%. The disparity is a direct result of its buyback program, which has reduced the company's share count from about 19.4 billion at the end of June 2018 to about 16.4 billion now.

Russia on the other hand has like the 2nd or 3rd strongest military in the world, has nuclear weapons, and has China as a potential ally. Russia and China together could crush the US in theory. Less simple in practice though.

If any big NATO nations declare war on Russia, they would likely start WW3. I do not think it is in anyone's interest to start WW3, but all it takes is one dumb leader making that mistake.",58,2022-02-24 08:27:52

3. 40% of ALL the companies had -70% losses and never made any of it back

So the chances are high you will underperform and a realistic chance of losing money or being completely broke.

Right now a lot of the automotive companies are investing heavily, and more importantly a lot of countries and states are swinging the market to electrification. Because of this the turn over in vehicles will be enormous. The only concern is the dealership and service based backlash. Yes electric vehicles need less involvement but with subscription and other future involvements they will adapt and survive. But realistically still decent plays if they are companies you can believe in. For a lot of companies it's less about where are they today vs where will they be in 5, 10, 20 years from now. We know people have become more and more connected. We know a lot of the digital rush is just picking up steam. Although I personally don't like FB, I will say meta is shockingly opportunistic.

stocks,"Here are my investment rules, please feel free to share yours , there is always something to learn from others ,i am a long term investor.",svotbd,"My rule is to invest in broad market ETFs unless I think I am smarter than the rest of the world and the market.

So 90+% of my new investments are ETFs and only occasionally do I buy individual stocks.  Of current holdings my three largest individual stocks are about 40% of liquid assets, so I do let my winners run, but my default buy is broad market ETFs.

Keep in mind that for every stock you buy, there is someone on the other side thinking that the price they are selling at is a good one.  Same when you are selling.

Invest the time it takes to do an honest, accurate measurement of your returns so you know whether or not your stock selections are helping or hurting you.   It is easy to remember the big wins and downplay the losses, and to convince yourself that you are better than you really are.   Don't confuse a bull market for brains.

When you have won, stop playing.   When you have achieved your financial goals then it is time to scale back some of the risky bets, or at least to take a good chunk of money off the table.   I do hold bonds (at the moment 13% of liquid assets, more typically 20%). They have served me well in the 23 years I have been retired and living off my investments.",7,2022-02-18 20:08:15

""Being greedy when others are fearful"" seems so easy to do when you look back in time. ""I would've bought the dip in 2008."" etc. etc.

I really hate those simplistic phrases that everyone parrots without actually thinking them through.

Being greedy in times of fear can be harder than it seems. Not everyone has the balls to buy a stock when it takes a 25% hit and then buy more when it takes a 50% hit.

Being afraid is smart in some markets.

If you were greedy when people got afraid at the first declines in 2000, 1929, 2008, you'd have destroyed your portfolio.

Lots of people try to average down when a dip happens, buying every subsequent dip. But then they run out of money if the dips keep coming. People got gutted doing this. 

Ignoring your portfolio is another simplistic idea that people always say.

If you have a sound investment strategy with conviction, looking at a red portfolio shouldn't scare you.

If you don't monitor your portfolio of 15-20 companies, you're going to miss a lot of catalysts that would better inform your investment decisions about those companies.

You also need to pay careful attention to macroeconomic data and world markets. Lots of people.gwt consumed by company specific data",5,2022-02-18 20:03:50

In February, some continued to buy in the $120 range. See below.

Is your cost in this range? If so, then you should at least be aware that company insiders thought the $120-180 range was a buy, based on their understanding of the business.

They may be idiots, but I think it's fair to say they have more insight into the business than us.

PYPL is an established company with a long and profitable operating history, an excellent balance sheet and good future prospects.

If you don't need the money, I would just sit with this paper loss and be patient. It may take a year or more, but I'm willing to bet it'll be back [edit: to $180, but probably not $300].

Personally I'm getting ready to buy PYPL, just waiting for some signs of strength.

Picking individual stocks takes an immense amount of research to know what is a fair price to buy at—and be able to know when market moves are warranted or not. 

You’re still very young, and having losses in the market at this stage is very common. 

You need to decide how you’re going to invest:

1. Passively in funds (there are a lot to choose from—but VTI/VXUS or simply VT are your best bets for total diversification. Contribute regularly and pay no attention to the market. 

2. Learn about economics, capital structures, how to read financial statements, bond market, monetary policy, and read news to learn how to value invest in companies you have conviction are undervalued. 

But don’t invest in individual companies without learning a lot. Some people like it and find it interesting, but many either don’t or have no time. 

Also keep in mind a lot of people are in your position: waiting for the chance to break even and sell. We’ve seen nearly every rally get sold recently.

stocks,What value do I bring by buying stocks?,syx9nk,"Well you certainly do not bring direct value to the business, but you create liquidity and demand for the stock and (very) slightly contribute to its upward momentum.

If demand is strong and the price is going up, the company is in a good position to finance itself by issuing new stock on the market either directly or through banks that will guarantee the price of the issuance.

The company that decides to use loans rather than dilute ownership will also be in a position to negotiate way better conditions if their stock is liquid and has a good value, because they have the choice to issue shares so they have a plan B if they don't get favorable terms on the loan.

TLDR : You kind of, in a very distant and minor way, bring value to a company by buying and owning shares.",54,2022-02-22 20:30:05

stocks,What value do I bring by buying stocks?,syx9nk,"You're not really helping the company much by buying their stock except for helping raise the price, but you're not buying $AAPL to help it grow or give it the 160. When stocks IPO, they have a set amount of shares they can sell and that's when the company will get their big bag of $$ usually. From then on they can look to sell more shares in a secondary offering, but you're not going to really help the company itself. 

Regarding stocks vs crypto, I will start with saying I don't personally believe in Crypto so I'm biased. When you buy a stock, you are buying something with a balance sheet and metrics that you can use to value it and judge if the stock is worth buying or not. Looking at AAPL, you're able to see how many phones/computers/iPad's they sold this year. You can see growth metric and how their healthy their balance sheet is. When you buy Bitcoin, there are no metrics that can tell you if it's undervalued or overvalued and there's also a lot less transparency & regulations in the industry. You can argue that you can price bitcoin based on the cost of electricity, which i think is a valid argument. To me though it's just pure speculation. They also are more volatile typically when comparing to solid companies in the S&P/Dow.  

To finalize my rant, I would recommend that if you want to be involved in the market and don't fully understand it, or follow it, to just buy some Index tracking ETF's. You can dollar cost average them (You put in ""X"" every month consistently. Some months you'll buy more others less, but you'll average out a good cost over time). If you do want to try buying single names that's fine but please do your research and buy things you believe in. I tell anyone who asks me for stock advice to buy companies they use frequently and think will be around in 20 years. Don't follow the crowds to try and get a quick buck, you might win but you'll more than likely lose. Also, re-invest dividends. The compounding after a couple years will surprise you and it's easy to do on your brokerage usually. Good luck in the market!",1,2022-02-22 21:59:35

stocks,What value do I bring by buying stocks?,syx9nk,"in terms of ""adding value"", you kind of are and you kind of aren't, so for example, the more buyers of a stock, the higher the stock price increases, right? the way that this ""adds value"" to the company is that when people calculate ""valuation"" of a company, they are including the price of the stock and number of shares, so like when you see an article with something along the lines of ""apple is now a trillion dollar company"" or whatever valuation it is, that number is achieved because of how high the stock price has risen so by buying more and more shares and driving the price up, you are increasing apple's ""valuation""

however, the money you spend when you buy a stock doesn't go to the company itself, it goes to other investors who are selling their shares to you, so your money isn't actually doing anything for the company in terms of helping the business progress.. so in a nutshell, yes you're adding ""value"" to the company in the sense that you're simply making it look good, but you're not adding ""value"" in the sense that you're giving the company capital, resources, or anything that it can actually use

it should also be noted that unless you're an institutional investor with millions of dollars to invest into a stock, the increase in the ""valuation"" when you buy is so miniscule that some might even argue that even in that sense, you're still not actually adding any value",1,2022-02-22 21:31:46

Most cryptocurrencies are definitely not a business that you partially own by buying the relevant coin. The currency itself is hard to value intrinsically and cannot be quantified using classical methods. So there can be made a case where cryptocurrencies are not equity.

Outside of IPO, stock options are the next biggest driver. It allows them to compensate the executives and those they deem are major contributors and can cost the company nothing (assuming they are using authorized shares that are unissued - causing dilution, they can also use treasury stock or stock already owned by the public as well - however that is not free).

Some people do technical analysis (making random lines on a chart to guess where a stock price will head next). If nothing else, Moving averages seem to have some merit to them. Another thing you need to be aware of is the risk tolerance you’re willing to perceive when buying an individual stock. Companies with high valuations must have excellent growth prospects in their reports or else they’ll fall.

2. Many of the former more established discount brokerage firms now offer $0 commissions on stocks, ETFs, and so.e mutual funds. A more established broker is a better bet. Robinhood has little to no customer service in the event you need to ask a broker a question. Check out E*trade, TD Ameritrade, Vanguard, Fidelity, or Schwab for your self directed needs.

3. It's tough to say which individual stocks to invest in. If people are new to investing i ask them what companies they like, or where do they shop? If they say I like the gap or whatever. Then Google whether the gap is publicly traded company. If it is, obtain the ticker symbol and purchase shares, or Google what ETFs hold xyz company (if you're interested in going the ETF route)

1. You do not need a financial advisor at this point in your lives. They will tell you to save an emergency fund of 3-6 months worth of expenses and then invest the rest. 
2. Do NOT use Robinhood. Use an established brokerage like Fidelity, Vanguard, Charles Schwab, etc. They offer great products and good customer support should you need it. 
3. Buy ETF or mutual funds. All of the companies above have great options depending on how risk-adverse you want your profile to be with very low management fees. They tend to be set it and forget it type of investments. 
4. You can just use ETF which track the overall market for you. They do all the work so you can just keep putting money in and they will do the rest for you.

stocks,Me and my wife are young. We want to invest extremely long term (like til we’re old old).,t0rgw5,"Read the Bogleheads book. Seriously. Then dump as much money as you can afford into a market index.

Easy. No advisors, no stock picking, just reliable and boring and effective. This is generally what people are recommending in this thread using slightly different words and levels of detail. As for a broker I’d steer clear of Robinhood but it’s not the most critical thing. My rec would be Vanguard or Fidelity.

If you do it right, this becomes an automatic investment that you don’t think about except maybe once a year when you re-balance and download a tax form. Dead simple. 

But seriously, read the book. This is really basic stuff that you should establish knowledge of. There’s a non-trivial amount of free money you can get by preferring tax-sheltered accounts (401k, IRA), which is basically the same as described above except it’s under an umbrella with tax implications - your money goes in tax free or grows tax free, you can put $X/yr into this special bucket before needing to use a regular bucket, you incur a penalty if you pull it out before retirement.

Do the math in excel.  1.5% over 35 years equates to hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars (depending on your investment) in fees paid to a guy who sends you a statement every month. 

2) You can, but you can't set up a Roth IRA in Robinhood.  Use Fidelity or Charles Schwab.  It takes 15 minutes to set the account up and another 3 days to link your bank account. 

3) VOO.  It's essentially a stock that contains small portions of the 500 largest companies in the US that are publically traded.  It is sometimes known as an ""S&P 500 Index Fund.""  The technical term is ETF or Exchange Traded Fund. 

4) You aren't putting your eggs in one basket with VOO.  It is made up of 500 companies including Microsoft, Apple, Google, Nvidia, and Berkshire Hathaway.  If you bought single stocks of any of the single companies I just listed, you would be putting your eggs in one basket.  

5) Another ETF that's popular is called ""QQQ.""  It's a NASDAQ index fund.  It is composed of 100 of the largest tech companies.  It is more volatile than the S&P500 (VOO), but it has returned better over the last decade.  You could split your investments 70/30 or 80/20 between VOO and QQQ.  

6) >Edit: adding this in. How do you people feel about programs like betterment? I’m heavily considering just doing this over ETFs since I can just ignore it and put money in.

You can put money into ETFs like QQQ and VOO and ignore them.  That's exactly what long-term, passive investing is.  You can set up automatic deposits from your bank account to your Fidelity/Schwab account on paydays.

If they were, they wouldnt be financial advisors to begin with because they would be rich managing their own money. If you want a advisor, find a close family member or friend who is rich and invests then ask them. Dont use a professional. They are terrible on average and you wont be able to tell the difference. Skip them and just watch a few youtube video on basic investing.
   1. Dont waste your time with advise. Just buy low fee index funds while you learn the system. By order of diversification, VTI, VOO and BKLC are the best picks. Just select one and plow money into them over time until you know what you are doing. A financial advisor will just convolute to make themselves seem important and wise. Again, if wise, they wouldnt need to do it for money.
2. I dont think they offer fractal but you really dont need them. Dont pick a broker based on that. Pick if based on fees and tools. Etrade tends to be the most newbie friendly for tools and general info. Robinhood is pretty bad with both and tends to post really horrible advise via 3rd party articles which hurts inexperienced investors. 
   1. Interactive Brokers (IB) has the best international market access if you ever want to buy foreign stuff directly but their tools are sort of iffy and I dont like their site. IB also tends to have the lowest margins of any broker if you ever decide to do that but I dont recommend it for a newbie.
   2. Fidelity is generally considered the fastest execution if you subscribe to some of their day trading tools. Again I dont recommend it. Day trading tends to be for gamblers or people who cheat by using and abusing their own followers. Aka, church-like nonsense.
3. Buy index funds like VTI, VOO and BKLC (See commend above). 
   1. Buying individual stocks if for people willing to put in the time and learn. If that is you, then allocate a small amount of money that wont hurt you if you lose it, and just go wild but read the financials, understand their business (if you dont, avoid) and learn valuation. Note that this takes a lot of time. If you dont have a good 10-20 hours a week to dedicate to learning, stick to the index funds till you do have time. If you have time, then there is a lot of money to be made once you have a big enough amount to invest.
4. Buy low fee index funds... that will resolve this issue for you.

Never NEVER NEVER let someone else manage your money. This is the mother all of F\*ups. Dont use betterment or any other nonsense. You can also ignore life insurance. All they do is invest it in stocks and bonds and give you scraps. Just do it yourself and you get better returns especially if you are young.

stocks,Can talk about Analyst Ratings and Price targets?,sxu0aw,"This is why I've always like Morningstar. They tend to do their analysis, and stick with their numbers. Even when there's a huge disconnect between share price and their fair value. The best example I've seen is Netflix. Morningstar for years had a price target wildly below the share price. Like 1/4 of the share price at times. And they stuck with it. It took years for the market to realize, but they were right. 

Many analysts however are at investment banks, and they have a financial incentive for you to buy. They want to manage your money, so they tell you something is a great buy. All the time. There are so many analysts that basically just chase stock prices. Price goes down, they say something changed and lower their target. Price goes up, they chase it higher.

To answer the questions you have:
1. Simplistically upstream makes more money when oil prices are high, downstream fares better when oil prices are lower provided oil products (gasoline, jet fuel, etc) are still relatively steady allowing for decent margins.

2. Halliburton and Schlumberger are service companies so they provide oil drilling services, well maintenance, etc to the Exploration & Production companies like Exxon, Chevron etc. HAL and SLB don’t own oil fields where as E&P companies have ownership in the fields. 

3. LNG important for countries with insufficient domestic natural resources to generate electricity.

On your questions...
ASML makes the primary tech needed to fab a modern day chip (EUV machines). They currently have a monopoly as these are insanely complex and expensive machines (think many many step process to end up with a super pure special laser at the end). ASML will stay a monopoly barring industrial espionage etc so they will tend to go up so long as chip demand is high.
INTC/AMD: The two main X86 players. They've gone back and forth for decades. INTC tries to fab in house (but also buys some TSMC). AMD used to fab but now primarily goes through TSMC.
NVDA: Wants to get into CPU's (has the Tegras and tried to buy ARM) but mostly the mackdaddy king of GPU (because they made CUDA the industry standard). In gaming AMD competes well (comparable GPUs) but in AI AMD has put up a poor effort (no CUDA competitor).
TSMC: The best fab today. Fabbing is extremely expensive (i.e. need massive massive capital to buy tons of ASML's machines and other such tools). Fabbing is essentially series of processes (chemical baths, laser treatments etc) to purify down a ton of silicon to a wafer and then one way or another (chemical, laser etc) carve circuits into it. Each step can have losses and tiny impurities can ruin the die. Because of how capital intensive it is, it tends to be winner take all. Whoever has the best fab will have folks want to fab with them ==>money to invest in the next gen of fab.

AMD vs INTC as leader: INTC was leader until ~2014ish. Then under poor leadership they made some critical mistakes. They didn't get into EUV for their process, they didn't invest enough in R&D etc. During that time TSMC got ahead of INTC in process and AMD came up with some important architectural innovations: chiplets. Make tiny chiplets that piece together (like ultra complex legos) rather than giant monolithic chips. The chiplets are easier to make (so yield is much improved) but you do pay a price (there's performance/energy cost making the interconnects between the chips).

Right now...INTC leads on desktop CPU...because they made their chip bigger in silicon (i.e. brute force) AND because AMD came out with their last version ~1.5 years ago. But desktop doesn't matter. The money is in Data Center. DC only cares about performance per watt (because higher watts==>higher heat==>higher space taken up).

As someone working in the field, there is almost no chance of gene editing being mainstream within even 10 years. One reason for that is that what's holding us back is not the ability to change genes, but our understanding of what changes are needed to achieve a specific result.

Some diseases are the low hanging fruit where the genetic mechanism is simple and well understood, but such diseases are the minority. The most valuable companies may thus be those that control the data and techniques to predict gene editing targets.

The only unknown is which companies and on which timeframe. It'll be here for sure in 100 years, but when will it first start doing more than curing 1 or 2 previously incurable diseases and treating cancer like it's doing today? When will it be applicable on a scale where it makes money? Within 10 years seems pretty certain, but it just as easily could do nothing for another 5.

Now, though, they've been beaten down so much and so far that there are some great finds to be had for cheap. I came across survey saying that biotech valuations haven't been this depressed in a long time relative to the broader market's, and they haven't been this oversold in a while

I try to buy revenue generating companies and these are on my buy list. All are innovative and financially healthy in proteomics, rare diseases and autoimmune conditions, RNAi therapeutics, diagnostics: HZNP, QTRX, FLGT, ARWR. CMPS my highly speculative pick

DRNA I had but it got bought out, showing promise in RNAi work

In general, I think one of two things can happen for biotech investor: their company either gets bought out, or it gets large enough that it starts to buy out others. You want to be in those companies, not the thousands (yes, thousands) that languish on the indices despite all the hype

Others are in biosimilars and are big pharma types and I think may do quite well just printing money as value stocks now: MRK, VTRS, OGN, SUPN, TAK, GRFS

Very hard to find the biotech companies with good, marketable, and actually lucrative science and hold on to the extremely volatile stocks of these companies. So I understand the appeal of ARKG

stocks,What's everyone's thoughts on Shopify?,sw1dm9,"I think it's very fairly value right now, but this market is brutal and it could easily go to $400 near-term. Shopify has a lot of potential upside, but you really have to believe in their growth potential and specifically whether their investments into future growth will pay off.

The company is in a bit of weird place right now in my opinion. Acquiring new customers is going to become harder going forward as they already so dominant in the ecommerce space and there's going to be a slowing of growth over the next year as so much growth was pulled forward during the pandemic. They're also starting to see more competition and while I believe Shopify has an attractive moat with their app store and various additional products like Shop pay, I do think maturing competition could hurt their pricing power. Even if Shopify is the best ecommerce platform, if you don't require all of their services and features, then cheaper alternatives will be fine.

I'm a long time share holder who's owned the company since it was trading below $100. I've worked in ecommerce for years and understand the industry well enough that I could see Shopify's potential early on. I've also been buying a lot of SHOP recently. I think fair value is in the range of $900 - $1100, but in this market I'm not sure any of it matters. I listened to their latest earnings call and honestly I didn't like it one bit. They didn't seem to care about concerns around rate at which they're spending money or issuing shares and while I think an argument could be made for both, the whole thing basically felt like a middle finger to investors trying to invest in them during a really difficult period. You couple that with relatively mediocre short-term growth and it's hard to own right now.

I've been thinking over the last few days what I want to do because I own a lot of SHOP. On one hand it's hard to sell because I've been buying a lot lately and actually think the stock will do quite well from here over a 5 year period, but that earnings call was crap and they've got a ton of headwinds this year. At the end of the day SHOP is mostly valued on growth and sentiment. Current earnings are non existent so for the stock to go up investors need to have conviction about future growth and profitably. The fact even I as someone who likes the company is having doubts about it in the near-term is probably a bit of a red flag.

So I think I'm going to sell my holding next week and I'm going to put that cash into places I think have more margin of safety and better near-term growth potential. If SHOP falls below $400 I will put that money back into SHOP, but right now I think any money in SHOP is dead money honestly. I can't even think of a catalyst that's going to take the price higher in the near-term. If the FED turns more dovish later this year, perhaps some investors will return to stocks like SHOP, but even then I think relative to other growth tech names SHOP will likely struggle this year.

$500 a share seems like a reasonable entry honestly. To answer your question directly, they're obviously going to continue growing, but I wouldn't make that the reason you invest. The stock price is already assuming a lot of that growth, and in the case of Shopify I really mean it when I say a lot of growth. You basically have to project 30-35% analysed growth for the next few years along with eventual margin expansion for the price to make sense. I think the growth assumed is realistic and perhaps a tad conservative right now, but just betting on a company because you think it will grow doesn't make it a good investment.",3,2022-02-19 20:21:28
stocks,What's everyone's thoughts on Shopify?,sw1dm9,I think the hype around Shopify got too big with the comparisons to Amazon and some saying you can’t even put a number on their TAM because it’s so big and endless. This created an almost cult/hype ride similar to Tesla that wasn’t back by financials. Now that the growth is slowing people are starting to value it based on its current financials and realizing how overpriced it is when looking at what it’s doing now and not 10 years in the future. It should probably be valued at 10x sales which is the same as AMD which has similar growth and financials while being in a different industry. That would put the market cap around 40 billion or almost cut in half,8,2022-02-19 11:27:17
stocks,What's everyone's thoughts on Shopify?,sw1dm9,"Im of the opinion that their ceiling is much lower than people think. Most of their clients sell discretionary items and I dont think they will be able to court large retailers without making big concessions for said clients. 

Further, since most of their retailers sell discretionary items, they are highly sensitive to macro and disposable income which is currently plummeting due to skyrocketing rents and general inflation.

Now that said, if they build out their own brick and mortar operations, it puts them one step closer to becoming a retailer themselves to allow them to go head to head against the other giants. At the very least, they can also offer logistical services which is also interesting. But both of these ideas are extremely costly and take a long time to build. Im also not sure how the ""high growth"" investor will take such a shift. They probably wont like it.

Im not going to invest based on those promises anyway. I never do and I think many younger investors have learned that lesson the past year. This isnt a small cap with a lot of upside. Its still $80b in a low margin arena. Id recommend not rushing in. Macro is not on their side. Right now, the reduction in disposable income is going to gut discretionary goods.

I know it has something to do with getting a ton of cheapo knick knacks from China and selling it on various websites and such. I know that young people will set up instragram ads and facebook ads for some doo-dad that they will have dropped shipped to the end customer.

Not sure how the whole thing works, but to me, there's no future in this. Here's why. 95 percent of these products are absolute garbage. Here's an example, my son got tricked by one of these dumb instagram ads for a chair cushion thing to support your lower back. It looked decent enough in the description. He ended up buying it, and when he got it, and opened it up, you could tell that it was just the cheapest sort of thing you could have possibly imagined. I think he paid like $18 or something, but when you looked at the item, you could tell that there's no way it cost more than 50 cents to manufacture.

I think he used this seat cushion thing for all of two days, and then threw it away. He said he'll never buy another cheapo product from China like this. Once bitten, twice shy.

To me, it seems like it's just a matter of time before everybody comes to a realization that 95 percent of this stuff is cheap garbage that isn't worth the trouble. They'll get burned once or twice, but won't fall for the same trick a 3rd time.

The companies that are considered dividend aristocrats have a long history of consistent dividend increases. Just remember to pick the company based on more than just having a high dividend yield. A company giving an 18% dividend isn’t very good if the stock loses 50% of its value. Also if you don’t need the money right away and your brokerage platform allows it I highly recommend making sure you have dividend reinvestment turned on. This way your dividend income will increase without you even trying.",56,2022-02-23 14:46:04

You can tell high quality companies if they gave a decent yield while not having to big of payout ratio and also doing share buybacks at the same time. For example LMT has a decent yield of almost 3% while paying less then half their cash towards their dividend. They use the rest of the money for share buybacks and investing back in the business.

I personally follow a modified DCA formula, been buying TQQQ and SPXL since last April, and been increasing TQQQ’s weekly allotment since QQQ dropped below -10% off all-time high a month ago.

In the 22-year history of QQQ, it only dropped more than 46% once, back in 2000 Tech Bubble Pop, and even then it was only *after* it rose 60% in six months. It bottomed at -46% during the 2008 debacle and hasn’t gone lower than -20% since then.

Now, anything could happen, foreign saboteurs could trigger a massive EMP event that renders all modern tech inert, and the NASDAQ would plummet (although how would we know if our screens don’t work..?).

But ask yourself if the entire tech sector and other components of the NASDAQ are at least half as valuable as they were just six weeks ago. If you think they are, then -50% seems like a *reasonable* worst-case estimate, in which case, at -16.44%, we’re already at a third of that.

Obviously you don’t have to load your whole cash slice into it all at once. But you do have to decide how much of a discount you’re looking for to qualify investing each of those dollars, and weigh that against the opportunity risk of missing a good deal after a sudden bull reversal.

Those who do not believe it, just put a reminder or keep watching my update for TQQQ. If I am right on TQQQ on that day, you decide whether I am right or wrong here.

Many people won't even believe what I say here, I have algorithm for it and time the TQQQ for swing trade successfully many times and waiting for my next opportunity to buy, which I do not know whether it is one week or 5 weeks or beyond, but I will come to know the bottom (or temporary bottom) on that day appx 15 minutes before close. It may not be 100% perfect, as future is always unpredictable, but market bottoms around that time (2-3 days lag). I will update once I grab bulk load of QQQ and TQQQ.",-4,2022-02-19 12:41:32

stocks,"If China ends up trying to invade Taiwan, wouldn't Intel be a good stock to hold for the next few months?",t0rrsn,"As an American who lives in Taiwan and having worked in the Semiconductor industry for over 25 years some comments on this topic. First most of the media and the talking heads don’t seem to articulate that Fab is only one small portion of how a chip gets made. You have lots of other pieces of the supply chain that even Intel is dependent on based in Taiwan. So you lose Taiwan you pretty much lose the entire chip supply chain period. No semiconductor company will be able to operate at anywhere close to capacity. Second most of the tech industry is reliant on chips from TSMC and other suppliers including testing packaging etc in Taiwan. So Apple, MSFT, Google, etc will all come to a grinding halt in their production lines. So will most of the auto industry, TV industry, cable industry, satellite industry etc. finally some little known other industries like e-bikes and even regular bikes. Taiwan has the largest bike component manufacturing in the world. So if you are betting in the market that China attacks Taiwan you have to be prepared for a 50+% drop in stocks. The Russian market drop will seem like a nothingburger in comparison. Intel will probably drop the same as any other tech company.

stocks,Market recovering seems to good to be true. Are you guys expecting a conflitct with this proportions do recover just like this?,t0scwv,"I think we’re likely to have a more volatile year but I think we’re going to end the year up, my call is somewhere in the range of 5000 for the S&P. 

My only concern is what happens with the Fed. If they raise too aggressively, we will likely have a recession in ‘23. If they raise too slowly, inflation will continue to be high. It’s a tough balance to strike given the enormous QE we saw in ‘20 and ‘21 but that was probably necessary given the circumstances.

Geopolitics, I don’t care. I don’t think there’s any real significant threat to the US economy. China invading Taiwan would be potentially very dangerous but that’s a much more dramatic move than what we saw from Russia given the economic implications surrounding semiconductors. China is also in a much better place than Russia so drastic moves probably don’t make sense.

P/E ratios remain pretty reasonable given the earnings growth we’ve seen. The speculative bubbles have bursted so I think the market is quite healthy and ready to make a move up.

If the Fed raises slowly, I think 5500 is in play. If they raise aggressively, I think the range widens as a looming recession will have to be priced in to the market so it depends on what weight the market gives that threat. I’d say anywhere from 4400-5000. If they manage to strike the perfect balance I think we end up around 5000-5200.

The short term is harder to predict but based on mean reversion and the strength of companies heavily weighted in the S&P I think we probably saw a bottom and rally from here.

The problem with PYPL is that extreme negative sentiment like this doesn't change over night. Stocks this hated can trade far far below fair value in the same way stocks that are loved (like PYPL a couple of years back) can trade far in excess of fair value. The same thing is happening with FB right now. It's obviously undervalued, but that doesn't mean it's going higher anytime soon.

It's not a bad buy here though. Sentiment will change eventually and PYPL will likely see a nice pop when that happens, but that could be years of trading at a discount to fair value. PYPL isn't the best company in the world but it's a good company, operating in a growing sector of the economy which is likely to sustain double digit growth rates for years to come. It's been around for decades at this point and it's not going anywhere soon which makes it a relatively safe investment long-term with attractive upside should sentiment change, but short-term who knows what's going to happen.

Maybe it's right for some investors, but I decided to sell for a variety of reasons:

* I came to the conclusion that I just don't understand the company or industry well enough to feel comfortable holding it. 

* MMM's dividend increases have been shrinking overtime, to the point of it only going up by 1 penny the last few years. I saw this as a red flag that MMM's management probably thinks that their fundamentals have been deteriorating in recent years.

* The ROI for MMM compared to the rest of the market over the time period I held it spoke for itself. I sold out for barely a 10% ROI with dividends included, compared to VTI & VOO going up significantly more over the same time period.",2,2022-02-24 22:25:23

They're currently priced as if they'll have zero to slightly negative growth going forward (which is convenient because that's about what they're getting).

I think some of the headwind is the lawsuit they lost involving the ear plugs provided to the military. That one is pretty scary bc I believe that literally 2 soldiers were awarded something like 100 million dollars (correct me if I'm wrong). I suspect they'll appeal that judgement and win, having the payout reduced. Even if this becomes a class action suit, I can't see a reason for this to not be more or less a blip in cash flow; they have $5B per year in earnings. 

I could see the stock returning 6-7% annually going forward. More, if they start showing any kind of growth. It's not sexy but could be a great addition if you're currently overweight in tech and growth stocks.",2,2022-02-24 21:45:01

Provided nothing has changed of course and your investment thesis was solid to begin with.

Amazon was reading at low values at one point when all their metrics in the business were great. You could have been bagholding them then as well.",7,2022-02-24 10:33:55

Take a Look at the big picture and you will come to the conclusion that risk off would have been the safer play, but you kept hearing „DCA“ and „buy the dip“ and „it’s not a loss if you don’t sell“ and „you can’t beat the market“.

The market has beaten it’s average for 3 years now and was way above historical growth rates. A little profit taking would have been something like: „being fearful, when everyone is greedy“

stocks,To those of you who are bagholding or took your losses ...,t07f68,"You'll be fine. 

A 50% gut punch to the finances sucks but it's not a mistake that will cost you a future. Some people don't find success in the market until later on in life. The important thing to take away from this is learning the lessons being taught right now.

Regarding those three companies, both Draft Kings and NIO are garbage. If it was me in your spot, I would get out of those positions. SOFI is somewhat better, even if it's not what I'd invest in, but it's still a *high* risk pick with an uncertain future.

Limit yourself to a handful of tickers (5), if you want/have the time to do the needed research to understand a company, otherwise it might be best to put your money into an index fund and just match the market. Nothing wrong with index investing, not everyone has either the time or stomach for managing their own portfolios.",3,2022-02-24 11:06:08

stocks,To those of you who are bagholding or took your losses ...,t07f68,"I'm holding companies, that are solid in my opinion and continue to perform on or above expectations in earnings. For example Amazon, Alphabet, Infineon, Marvell, Mercado Libre. There is no way these won't recover to new all time highs.

I'm also holding some solid but riskier companies, that I simply believe in. Square and Uber for example.

Well and I'm also heavily bagholding super risky companies, that turned out to be massively overhyped (first stocks I bought while having no clue what I'm doing). Very good food company and Burcon nutrascience. Still somewhat believe in burcon, but I think VGFC could very well go bankrupt and go to zero. Lesson learned.

Like many of us, I startet investing in the beginning of last year, not 2015 or something, so my portfolio is 25% in the red and falling.

I'm not super concerned, just wished I had more cash now. Keep reading those earnings. If the company keeps reaching their goals, ignore the ups and downs and keep investing in those. There is no use in selling for a loss if the company itself stays healthy. Only realise losses if the company misses expectations over longer periods of time (one to two years).

Ignore the buzz, focus on fundamentals. It hurts, but you'll most likely be fine that way, five to ten years from now.",1,2022-02-24 15:00:13

You liked those companies before the market fell. You don't like them now because the price dropped. If you truly believe in the companies, hold on and wait for recovery. If you realized you bought on hype, dump 'em.

Meli, Paypal, SE, Pins. All great companies with great numbers and businesses. I do believe they were overvalued and I didnt see that coming so I entered at a high price.
