wallstreetbets,POV: you enabled options trading 48 hours ago,t26wfo,"i once had a conversation with a finance major friend of mine who is much smarter about this stuff than i am he said that money the economy and everything else is governed by only two things the amount of physical calories it takes to produce something whether that be energy from human expenditure fuel of some sort pack animals whatever and the collective human perception of value that’s it energy spent and value perceived if everybody wanted to right now humans can decide that assets belonging to wealthy people were suddenly value less i understand that it’s a lot more complex because they wrap their assets into  the system in an attempt to make it so that if we try to fuck them over the system itself gets fucked over but in practice it’s entirely feasible for someone to look at someone else and say “your money doesn’t exist because we all say it doesn’t“

conversely it’s entirely feasible for a group of people to collectively say “this money now has value because we all see it does“ that’s precisely what happened with many different countrieshttpsenmwikipediaorgwikiredenomination when they rebuilt their economy inflation was going off the charts but they simply rebooted their system very cleverly and suddenly there economy was stable again because people trusted the value of their new currency

so yes in practice at least in part what this person is saying is absolutely true what theyre missing of course is the fact that labor fuel water electricity and other very basic things have a literal energy cost acquainted with them in fact maybe that’s how we should measure things in the economy based on how much energy and time it took to produce something rather than other more arbitrary ways",12,2022-02-27 01:22:44

wallstreetbets,What the fuck is a Bloomberg terminal?,sz8fsq,today its software that runs on your computer you get direct market access so you can lose your money quicker but the selling point is the the community you get access to unlike us with a bloomberg terminal you get to chat with actual traders not crayon eating door knob licking cuckolds from wsb,2045,2022-02-23 04:42:15
wallstreetbets,What the fuck is a Bloomberg terminal?,sz8fsq,"i have a bloomberg at work and it just gets you all the information thats available in the fastest possible way also of course real time data and most important for my job you can trade with all possible counterparties via bloomberg otc buy beeing able to compare prices the k per month are just a fraction of the money you can safe on a single  trade

i would say most bloomberg users also just use  of all the functions and tools bloomberg is providing since its all the way from news fixed income fx equity pricing models

another thought on the price keep in mind that a single employee probably cost a bank at least k usd per month for salary it back office costs and not to forget office space going into tens of tousands of dollars for higher paid ones
the extra k per month for bloomberg is just a little extra and its worth it

 starting in vietnam jumping to the first gulf war and again jumping to afghanistan skips a number of significant conflicts what about yom kuppur soviet invasion of afghanistan panama bosnia to name a few 
 conflicts may be a contributing factor to macroeconomics but rarely are a dominant one this is especially true with isolated expeditionary interventions also conflicts may be more a reflection of the state of an economy ie look at these evil guys trying to kill you and forget about you own dismal finances

russia would send infiltrators and declare independent republics out of a city or two in those countries backed by several thousand green mennonflagged military and use that to take the baltics over to create a land bridge to kaliningrad

the sequence here is that apples privacy settings have cut fb off from a lot of value in personalized advertising that was genuinely new information and it is a big deal

fb has been promoting oculus from before this occurred but its obviously acquired urgency fb needs to find some way to get beyond apple devices and browsers oculus is one way theres a reason bezosamazon launched the fire phone and that googles been willing to pour a ton of money into the pixels    it turns out that who owns the datastream from the eyeballs really matters

zuckerberg and company are also aware of two other factors

 the fb audience is old and stagnant and when it comes to advertising growth youth really matters
 the fb brand had become politically toxic google did something similar with alphabet

so all in all 

fbs problem isnt caused by a bet on meta rather meta is the strategy to answer the problem caused by apple politics and demographics its an answer that they forged out of their own technical aspirations and it can work but it should be understood not as some unforced change but rather the response to exogenous challenges 

meta cant begin to make up for what apple has cut out of fbs income its the start of a strategy surely more to come think of what bill gates did back in the s when he saw the internet and netscape browser that was an all hands on deck realignment satya nadella did something similar with cloud enabled applications and azure more recently fb faces that kind of a challenge",35,2022-02-22 18:55:47

it seems like people were initially excited about the metaverse it was only when the recent quarter revealed the core business was starting to erodefacing increasing competitionissues that people turned on the idea of spending billions and billions on something that was a giant gamble from the start facebook went overnight from being viewed as a relatively stable get and forget fang member and the metaverse on top to being viewed as a gamble that may be more reliant than people thought on a massively expensive gamble 

are facebook ready to take a loss while the metaverse is being built or do you think they will soon announce the closure of the project 

i think theres a lot of shareholders who saw facebook as one thing and now see it as another that clearly arent willing to go along for the ride i would be surprised if facebook stops the project

did meta actually have a solid business plan for this investment

i guess i have the metaverse in mind as a significant evolution of sandbox online games taking a lot of elements of what has made those games so successful and significantly expanding upon them and if they can do that and make it compelling could certainly do well can you take a massive sandbox not revolving around a game like gta o and make it more about a hangout with some fun light activities and make that compelling enough to stick around and return again and again i dont know but im also not long fb if they can the business is lucrative for the same reason online games are today  probably considerable amounts of microtransactions theres tons of metaverserelated news continuing from disney nike and others  they clearly see this as yet another opportunity to sell people the same things only this time digital versions if the metaverse is successful its definitely definitely not only going to be facebook that benefits so if im nike or other such companies i want to see this be a huge success",11,2022-02-22 11:13:17

you need to do your own due diligence i dont give investment advice and when one makes a seven figure trade the due diligence is pages long but ill add just a few notes

they havent even monetized whatsapp which has b reach in the world im not sure americans understand how reliant places like india and brazil are on whatsapp you literally order food get a cab and speak with your doctor via whatsapp its essentially a public utility for most of the world and it continues to grow yet the money faucet hasnt been turned on there is likely tens of billions yet to be tapped into here

threats of tiktok were overstated intentionally reels isnt yet monetized instagram continues to grow growth of blue facebooks core product were in line its gotta saturate at some point yes ios  privacy changes hurt but there are ways of aggregating data on the backend using personal identifiers as a way of building your ad profile this will take time but they will continue to grow despite what legendary sandbagger cfo wehner says and keep in mind meta doesnt sell your data they sell targeting people love to misquote this and the talent they have at the company my god is the best in the valley

lastly i dont care if you love him or hate him zuck will go down as one of the greatest capital allocators of all time buying instagram for b and which is now worth well over b buying whatsapp for a paltry b which essentially owns messaging worldwide and is the worlds communication utility except for the us which they are trying to break into did you see the ads during the afc championship game and now the metaverse google and microsoft are bleeding top talent to meta to build the metaverse which will be capex heavy for years meta is lightyears ahead in this space and dont get it twisted  while you may not use the metaverse gen z will in ways they already are and they will spend money in it it is the future whether you like it or not

if we leave defi and nfts out of the equation for now what can be done with it

digital fraud protection rentals

networks with their own blockchain like bitcoin can essentially let other faster cheaper to use systems called layer networks pay in btc or eth or whatever to rent digital fraud protection which allows them to bootstrap new decentralized networks at a fraction of a fraction of the original networks infrastructure security and electrical costs while still inheriting important security guarantees from the layer network 

one example would be the lightning network

another example would be microsofts opensource ion nodes which provide global decentralized identity services and which pay the btc network in btc in exchange for allowing them to write synccheckpoints to the ledger which can be used to sync ion nodes around the world and guarantee that any random ion node on earth contains only valid identity data

essentially a good network system is like a trustworthy public datastore with security guarantees built into the structure there are some really cool digital security things that can be done when individuals each have their own publicprivate keypairs address  sending keys for the address

one example might be an anywhere singlesignon account that isnt tied to a google or facebook account that gathers data on every site you use the account to signin on and where you dont lose access to your favorite sites if you close your fb account or whatever",25,2022-02-22 17:21:19

in the late s in america prices were rising fast in other words inflation was running rampant usually thought to be the result of the oil crisis of that era government overspending and the selffulfilling prophecy of higher prices leading to higher wages leading to higher prices the fed was resolved to stop inflation so chairman paul volcker who is pictured above kept raising rates in  and ’ eventually bringing both the economy and inflation to a standstill

the fed showed great “ability to effect change” to use your phrase though the cost of killing inflation was a deep recession you could hardly call the fed’s behavior “inaction”

investing,Why is tech going up today?,t0jd24,"posted this in another thread on here but im going to paste it here since its also relevant

let me introduce to you this little concept called sell the news

okay that being said i still think this likely will go down further but thats a longer term view markets do weird shit in short term timespans and tend to be more reflective of whiplash effects market positioning sentiment etc ive lost count of how many times people have posted here about the market not reacting like the think it should be thats not how markets have ever worked and i wouldnt ever assume markets to be rational or efficient especially in the short run

if youre looking at this purely from a fundamental perspective you need to ignore day price effects and swings day time frames are just not compatible with fundamental investing

if you want the likely explanation of why we are rallying here is my personal take which is just an opinion

 markets have been hedging for this risk for the better part of  weeks if not longer so now that its happened the hedgers and wouldbe sellers have already sold this leaves a lopsided positioning effect where those who are hedged take profits on their options or short positions and people who have sold no longer have extra positions to sell off in bear markets this effect is why you get violent squeezes after selloffs 
 the press conference announcing sanctions was likely less extreme than markets expected markets were likely expecting more sanctions on energy which would have caused havoc for both russia and europe with no major announced sanctions on energy supply going to europe the focus is simply on russian banks and other financial intermediaries this is a strong sanction but still less than what was expected given full swift cutoff was a possibility
 i would wager the most significant pain is occurring coming from institutions and funds that hold russian or ukrainian sovereign debt which has taken massive drops this along with volatility rising forces deleveraging and derisking which comes on both the long and short side firms that balance longs against shorts have to actively buy back short positions and then sell long positions to degross their book hence why you often get these big factor rotations like what weve seen today where everything that was great for the last few weeks is suddenly bright red where the losers have suddenly rallied significantly in this instance there was massive positioning into financials and energy and to an extent value factor since the start of the year that is getting unwound a bit here",13,2022-02-24 20:36:54

okay maybe ships are going to be the pipeline a qmax tanker holds  thousand cubic meters russia would need to send  ships down to china in a year to supply  billion cubic meters or  ships going one way a day through the artic shipping route it seems improbable that russia has that many extra lng tankers waiting on the side

on the other hand russia provides that amount to the eu something that isnt going to be replaceable overnight either both sides will suffer immensely eu will go through austerity measures where it uses lng as russia provides  of their capacity while russia will need to figure out how to maintain its economy with  of its lng exports being stopped if this was the beginning of winter id say that russia would have a lot more leverage than it does rn purely talking about lng stakes",18,2022-02-22 15:46:50

investing,"Is the S&P 500 still overpriced? CAPE PE says it is, but, why should I use that and not a forward PE?",t09j6f,"hi  finance analyst here

forward pe does not tell you what the present value of future earnings is it tells you what the future expected premium is and as a buyer you dont want to be buying in a rising forward pe environment because that suggests you are paying more and more for the same or less earnings

there are certain metrics like cape and like price to fair value that can tell you in a single metric that the hunch about the market getting disproportionately overpriced is a fair assessment heres why

companies forecast earnings all the time  they generate earnings all the time   the reason cape exists is to temper our tendency to accept a drifting mean  but it also tells us whether or not those forecasts have been materializing over the long term

if there is a premium in quarter  for beating earnings and a premium in quarters  through  for beating earnings and every quarter thereafter into the future or the past why should that premium keep increasing  this signals that real growth g is not increasing in proportion to return on capital r

in other words cape is already a ratio if it gets larger then the premium is increasing faster than earnings  thats what you want as a seller not as a buyer

to expand on this

its not so much the metric you should be looking at its the direction and magnitude of change in that metric over time

in finance we tend to look at multiple metrics to among other reasons make sure we arent just picking the one that favors our desired outcome or rationalizes our biases

if forward pe is growing over time that doesnt necessarily mean the company is growing  conversely if forward pe gets lower over time it can mean that the company is delivering more actual growth than stock price appreciation

it means that in the future the premium for the same earnings will be higher and we expect that because time value of money price to fair value is a better indicator of the premium for future earnings because it is discounted to present value

ideally you want a company like berkshire that promises and delivers actual growth and therefore its price to fair value remains relatively constant within a fairly narrow window year after year

if you were to compare forward pes you would likewise see more deviation of price from earnings because really in the last five decades the market has been clocking in a  annualized growth in earnings so if price is growing more than  then we know it is not tracking proportionally

and we can also see this reflected in price to fair value market to gdp and a variety of other metrics that tell us that the market is indeed overpriced or to more completely explain the expression overpriced relative to what we know that the return on capital r is accelerating at a rate disproportionate to actual economic growth g and this eventually leads to unstable economic conditions for a variety of reasons

investing,Did the fed wait too long?,t0csuu,"hind sight  probably yes the most reasonable argument i have heard really doesnt deal with interest rates but qe in march of  the fed had to move to calm the markets especially the bond markets

however by fall of  markets were working again spx hitting ath again bond market was stabilized and working well at that time one could make an argument that was the time to start to taper their open market operations qe because it was no longer needed

however hind site is   the reasoning of the fed was target inflation was  however  was also sort of the upper limit they allowed inflation to get so if  was the upper limit  but also the target you never hit the  so many thought this was too aggressive and letting inflation run hotter for a bit it would improve the labor market maybe improve lower wage workers that had been largely left behind

however the stock market valuation isnt really part of the fed mandate  i guess one could argue it may affect price stability but i think the fed is more concerned with consumer staples and the bond market not really the stock market

so i think the fed now is in inflation fighting mode if oilgas spikes that will just add fuel to inflation so yes the fed will raise rates now the question is how much will they raise rates  times  times  times",18,2022-02-24 15:24:08

drops like we’re experiencing now will always end and then go back to where they were the problem is predicting how long the sell off continues until markets bottom out before recovery begins and then the recoveryclimb back duration can also take time for example 

 the great depression in  after the sp reaches its peak the index continues to drop for several years before it reaches the bottom the recovery begins but sp doesn’t get back to  levels for decades 
 collapse of bretton woods oil crisis etc  sp reached its peak in early  and the sell off began bottom wasn’t reached until autumn  recovery began and sp didn’t get back to  levels until 

since then we’ve had a mixture of crashes and recoveries with some being short and sharp eg march  where volatility and subsequent recovery occurred in a matter of months massive outlier 

 was the last real financial crisis and again long and painful  bottom wasn’t reached for best part of  years and it wasn’t until  we saw the sp get back to the previous high seen in  

that’s why the best strategy is dollar cost averaging especially if you’re risk averse and never forget that that the blue chips of any index constantly change two decades from now apple and amazon could theoretically be distant memories  this why an index fund is your best bet as they rebalance the fund regularly to account for this",19,2022-02-24 14:36:49
