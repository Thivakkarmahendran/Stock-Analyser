putin has been cucking the west for  years at least a large reason for his success has been nato’s repeated stupidity since  driving up global energy prices with bush that allowed russia to reform from a debt ridden society to a surplus nation able to arm itself again fostering a coup in georgia in  and then convincing the georgians to try and occupy parts of north ossetia in  funding losing insurrectionists in the syrian civil war while assad now more entrenched than ever became more dependentloyal to russia failing to make a deal with iran and therefore allowing that major opec chip to be a cog in the russiachina framework and not nato thus losing market share control same with venezuela funding insurrectionist in the ukraine since  without an actual plan to hold or take crimea even though it was obvious the russians would annex it immediately because of the value of sevastopol 

and now this putin is a formidable opponent but he’s going against arrogant amateurs and thus keeps taking pounds of flesh south ossetia abkhazia crimea eastern ukraine etc who’s next 

and importantly since the united states splooged  trillion losing a war against afghan goat herders and iraqi cab drivers accomplishing nothing putin knows that our military is just spent and has no desire for another more real fight

out of curiosity what data are you relying on to call a peak in inflation 

the most up to date us data i have is the january inflation number at  which was  higher than december which was  higher than november which was  higher than october which was  higher than september which was  higher than august

as far as i can see theres nothing to suggest that january was a peak but rather a trend

stocks,Why I’m bullish,sz34c2," interest rate hikes have been priced in at this point unless the fed does something totally unhinged the market should respond positively when the hikes start being implemented

priced in assumes the market is rational it also assumes nothing changes the fed may also need to do something unhinged if inflation expectations remain high or worsen despite tightening

 economic data is strong consumer spending gdp growth unemployment numbers etc periods of high inflation aren’t necessarily indicative of economic issues gdp contraction and unemployment are much better indicators

high inflation is fine for the markets the risk is with inflation comes rate hikes and that we may be entering an inflationary spiral which the fed will need to induce a recession to fix it its probably unlikely but we just dont know for sure how this will play out yet there are clearly a lot of extremely smart people worried about the situation we find ourselves in right now

 russiaukraine is a temporary situation ww is not going to happen i’m not staying that russia isn’t going to invade but it doesn’t pose any long term risks to the us economy

putin is becoming increasingly unhinged and it wouldnt be that hard to imagine what happened yesterday being looked back on by future generations as the catalyst for a much more serious conflict at some point russia is going to go to far and things will need to escalate to war even if it is a proxy war with the west another thing i worry about is that the sanctions cause putin to lose the support of his people i worry that putin is the kind of guy who would rather risk starting a world war in an attempt to rally the country behind him than to step down peacefully

but to your point i dont think further escalation is an immediate risk to markets i do worry over the next decade were likely to see more serious geo political risks like this play out if markets are nervous about russia and ukraine imagine how the market is going to react when china tries to take taiwan

 supply chain issues will ease as many companies have guided this and as someone who works in logistics i can tell you that the disruptions are easing

sure but i think the main risk here is that we see a wageprice spiral that persists after the supply chain issues ease

gdp and unemployment are not realtime indicators not that i think they are problematic right now but the stock market is a leading indicator and were going to see economywide issues show up in stock prices before they show up in gdp and unemployment

i also think its way too early to decide that the ukraine issue is contained in any sense troop commitments arent an economic factor but this crisis will likely cause major trade disruptions and result in serious political difficulties in europe ukraine is a significant exporter to western europe and taking their goods out of trade will result in rising prices",13,2022-02-23 00:47:20

stocks,Norway says its sovereign fund will divest from Russia,t2xwcj,"no they will not divest or liquidate instead these assets will be written off as losses because of sanctions nobody will pay for them in usd and journaling them to roubles and selling them is also useless as they wont be able to get the money coverted to usd and out of russia due to their foreign researves being frozen this is peanuts btw get ready for s of billions of losses collectively on the balance sheets of european companies that hold any assets in russia along with any commodity futures that they may hold

this is a financial atomic bomb on both european and russian markets and everyone will feel the costs unless some sort of sanction waivers get applied like in iran where they are still allowed access to foreign researves to barter with chinaindia",13,2022-02-28 01:16:29

stocks,I think the war in Ukraine shows well why you shouldn't buy and hold Chinese Stocks (at a large extent),t3lsow,"im taiwanese and were not really worried at all about china actually invading 

what most westerners misunderstand is the concept of face in china face is everything here and china cant lose face in the east so while it might be new to the west theyve been gesturing like this pretty much for the past  years none of this is new for us 

so every time our president says something like two nations they do a military exercise or arrange some missiles or release a warning and our politicians softens their language but no one actually really worries about actual invasion because of one thing money

taiwan is the th largest trading partner with china and many of their top corporations are actually taiwanese meanwhile they account for  of our trade  tsmc produces the vast majority of their silicon foxconn is one of their biggest manufacturing companies both are taiwanese 

our economies are pretty much tied together so if we go down they go down and they are more afraid of losing their middle class right now than anything else which is why theyre mostly focused on domestic control

unlike ukraine were also not really a political threat ukraine joining nato is an escalation but unless the us suddenly ships nukes to us and want to put us on the security council china doesnt have anything to gain here aside from killing a silver geese i wouldnt say were gold but were at least like bronze 

our situation isnt the same as ukraines because we dont have any natural resources so we mostly import our resources from well china 

china has about  different moves to make before a military one if they really cared to disrupt the status quo a ton of taiwanese people work in china they could literally just cut off all visas they could cut off flights they could cut off our celebrities and wed be affected they could cut off tsmc china steel foxconn  cathay mediatek and wed be fucked but again so would they

they dont really have anything to gain though they just need to look like they do we get that they have to save face",153,2022-02-28 20:51:14

mathematically pltr is hitting or nearmissing all important earningfinancial benchmarks and guidance fundamentally pltr is building a robust moat by developing and marketing a data management and analysis ecosystem that is technologically top of the linemost advanced in the market once its software is more widely known in the commercial market i think it will very quickly start to be adopted by big name companies with complex data needs anecdotally i work in the dod ive used their software in a deployed combat environment and trust me we in the dod know about shitty computerssoftware working with palantirs software made me a believer in their quality their ability to turn seemingly disparate extremely diverse and complicated data into actionable analysesresults further i have recent comp sci  college graduate friends and during career day while the top  go to faang only the top  are even looked at and given offers to work at palantir

stocks,'Palantir isn't a palatable stock even after its big decline'.,syvlns,"pltr is going through an s curve slow adoption and growth at first government contracts only and are now breaking into commercial sector nato alliance only

the share based comp dilutes the share price but it’s pretty interesting seeing the misunderstanding people have the float has gone up because the company is using its stock as a currency to pay out for talent 

the company has actually had minimal share issuance since their direct listing as a matter of fact even the sbc is slowing down year over year 

the company is m positive free cash flow no debt and has a stable foundational client with government contracts so if you think the shares will go to  then perhaps you dont understand what holding equity truly means there’s almost zero chance of bankruptcy risk where debt holders wipe equity holders and the company is taken over by debt holders because there’s no debt… 

so depending on one’s stomach for volatility you can buy and own a unique company that has the track record for execution at the highest and national security levels of demanding

this is a long hold and see how they grow their commercial side of the business the nearest competitor people assume is snowflake but snowflake might not be the one instead i believe it’s crm they are slowly taking over every silo of enterprise softwaredata crm project management slack workday via partnership etc the vision is to have a unified system where every application sends through a stream of data for analysis on one platform crm is trying to do this by being that unified vendor

i believe the opposite to be the real future that pltr foundry is the unified platform wrapping all enterprise apps and collecting the streams of data for analysis

so it’s either a  haircut not  because there’s no bankruptcy risk or a x return based on dcf modeling from these levels as the company grows through its high growth segment of s curve

people really allow price action to dictate their narrative but stock prices doesn’t always follow product development and adoption here as wallstreet analysts aren’t systems engineers eps has nothing to do with how the pltr platform is being deployed and used by new customers who signed multi million dollar deals i would change my hypothesis if i have facts that show customers are dumping the core product after several years of deployment and usage but i have not seen that quite the opposite with how sticky they are

individual investors also have an advantage over professional fund managers as hundreds of millions or billions of dollars flow into their funds the managers are forced to buy lesser performing stocks to avoid overconcentration in their best stocks and to maintain diversification that dilutes the effects of their top performers and lowers overall performance they tend to regress to the mean

individual investors do not have that problem they can concentrate on their best performers and arent forced to buy lesser performing stocks

individual investors also have another advantage over wall street professionals as peter lynch the legendary manager of the fidelity magellan fund who beat the sp  for many years explained in his book one up on wall street

stocks,Wait for the dip after the dip of the dip before buying or averaging down? What’s your opinions on here?,szkhn7,if the financials check out and they’re a good company but the stock keeps dipping don’t focus as much on the stock price a lot of times i see with investors is they’re willing to go along with these companies that have terrible financials but are excellent pump and dumps if you believe in the company and the financials tell a good story then stick to it right now i’m in a company ticker ycbd their stock price has taken a plunder for the worse however they have great products and the financials line up as far as debt to equity and cash on hand if they were plundered in debt and outstanding liabilities i’d say no way i’m a listen to everyone and find my exit position but if the financials and quality of productsservices line up i tune out the noise wait until i get some purchasing power and load up you also have to have a strategy of will i invest in a company short term or long term as well as i’ve gotten better i like playing options short term but again if good company i’m looking long term and even if the stock drove down to a penny and the boxes check i’m licking my chops buying more some people panic when a company’s stock price drops and that’s their only indicator others lick their chops and think of it as a clearance sale,12,2022-02-23 15:55:37

ive been downvoted across many subs for basically saying that russians have got the upper hand here i was wrong on invasion because then youre looking at a  million people country that would be insanely difficult to occupy what will putin do when ukraine surrenders  i have no idea

however despite the invasion i still believe they have the upper hand 

 the current sanctions mean jack

 russians picked the time of invasion when there is a global energy crunch and massive inflation  no one is even considering placing an embargo on russian exports like oil and gas that are crirical to global economy they also make a ton of aluminum which you guessed correctly is in huge demand now as well

 last option for west to implement is removing russia from swift which some would claim would be devastating theres some conflicting info here as supposedly russia only accounted for  of all swift transactions regardless if the west decides to go that route then russia has an entire hand of dick moves they can pull off one of them being dropping the petrodollar if that happened wed be screwed because next country in line to drop that would be china and they buy every drop of oil and gas from them

stocks,What triggered the Dot Com Crash?,syyutn,"i’m just gonna leave this here because no one seems to be answering your main question

nasdaq peaked on friday march  

the initial trigger is attributed to news on monday march   that japan had once again entered a recession this triggered a global sell off that disproportionately affected tech stocks

yahoo and ebay ending merge talks on march   exacerbated the fall

then further exacerbated by barron’s march   featured article titled “burning up warning internet companies are running out of cash — fast” this article is considered pivotal in the bust and an excellent piece of journalism that laid out the reality of the market and where things were headed i recommend reading it

then on april   microsoft is found guilty of monopolization and tying in violation of the sherman antitrust act which further exacerbated negativity

then the internet companies’ earnings started to roll out which  confirmed barron’s report

then a few months later the bankruptcies started

imagine like tech in  was  todays spacs  actual real companies the nasdaq was mostly composed of fraudulent companies no growth no revenues some didn’t even have products companies where  of their expenses went into exuberant marketing campaigns it was an ocean of wish nklas and clovs and then there were amazon microsoft and cisco lost like tears in rain",407,2022-02-22 23:08:05

rio

nio

bp

edit i’d like to explain my choice as well

voo is an easy pick and could also be easily replaced with spy but i prefer voo for lower cost with this one i am exposed to all relevant us companies

rio is mining company with excellent dividend with headquarters in uk and australia and operating in all continents or most not sure about this but they are widely present they are also undergoing expansion especially in lithium mining and maintaining their iron ore production which is mainly being bought by china need for ore in china is constantly growing and i don’t see this changing in the next  year period rio would be my stock of choice if i could invest in only one company mostly because of their long history stability and high dividend yield

nio is basically just a high risk chinese growth stock but at a current price they have much more upside potential what i like the most about the company is their completely different approach to batteries in cars i think their future will be focused on battery swap station they own patents more than ev they are already leaders in battery swap business in china recharging batteries in ev’s is just not a sustainable model as even if we advance in fast charging i don’t think we could beat their swap time of  minutes not sure how it works exactly or if it’s completely true but their page claims their vehicles have free lifetime warranty quite confident about their product aren’t they 

bp is one of the most relevant energy stocks in europe it would be hard to choose between this and xom but bp already showed it’s intention to move forward with their green energy program and they will be forced to focus more on that sector as europe is moving to that direction much faster than us i think they will suffer in the process but they are already one step ahead us energy companies once their huge oil capital settles in green energy they might become growth stock in the next  years also they have decent dividend russian conflict will also force them to focus more on alternative energy sources but they have enough money to invest in it only problem is their mental ceo once he is gone the stock will skyrocket

i like to invest in stable companies that are looking into future the same way i do and that’s electric everything will be electric in the future no doubt but we will need lot of materials and oil to do so that’s why i choose bp and rio that are moving towards sustainability i also like to take some gambles and i think nio is the best gamble

if you want to invest in single stocks you have to do a lot of research and you should probably buy at least  different ones to spread your risk that takes hours upon hours of research to get yourself up to speed on investing before you could even think about making good choices thats why for the casual or new investors its just better to get index funds while you learn the ropes and do a lot of reading once you figure out whats going on with stocks then maybe dip your toe in the water by taking  of your investment money and play around buying a few stocks and try to hold them for a few years to see if they profit",12,2022-02-28 09:06:46

stocks,What value do I bring by buying stocks?,syx9nk,"well you certainly do not bring direct value to the business but you create liquidity and demand for the stock and very slightly contribute to its upward momentum

if demand is strong and the price is going up the company is in a good position to finance itself by issuing new stock on the market either directly or through banks that will guarantee the price of the issuance

the company that decides to use loans rather than dilute ownership will also be in a position to negotiate way better conditions if their stock is liquid and has a good value because they have the choice to issue shares so they have a plan b if they dont get favorable terms on the loan

tldr  you kind of in a very distant and minor way bring value to a company by buying and owning shares",56,2022-02-22 20:30:05

stocks,What value do I bring by buying stocks?,syx9nk,you are helping them but it’s very very miniscule you’re increasing demand for their stock thereby increasing stock prices in theory this provides some value to younger growing companies by allowing them to raise money in the future but as far as established companies go you’re not really doing anything in reality as an individual with a relatively modest trading account in either case you’re not really doing anything to help them lol,20,2022-02-22 20:29:07

for the upside makes sure you have a price target based on your dd and actively monitor i typically sell  or  if it grows  no harm in taking profits if it doubles i sell half and let the remainder ride as i view these as free shares from my original investment dollars they become part of hold and forget portfolio that i only tap if i need the money for a big purchase car home remodel vacation

wallstreetbets,Germany to produce 100% green energy by 2035 instead of 2050 thanks to Putin,t3iz17,"i work in this business in that country our goverment doesnt have any idea what there are talking about some of key points are the main problem is number 

 we already make to much electricity in the summer weekends we then have to turned down wind generaors and big photovoltaic power plants but you get  compensation from the goverment if we have to turn them down

 there is no cheap way to store huge amounts of electrictythis problem will get much worse in the future point  correlates

 wind and photovoltaic are highly volatile they dont produce the electricity when we need it

 the only renewable base load capable enery source is geothermal and germans dont want that because we fucked that up httpswwwatlasobscuracomplacesstaufengermanyhttpswwwatlasobscuracomplacesstaufengermany

 we dont have to manpowerskilled workers to reach that goal if we want to reach the goal we would must install  more photovolatic modules in the coming years

 most germans arent green they just hate we have some of highest energy costs in the world

 the whole thing only exists because we poured over  billion € in goverment subsidies in it maybe  of the people are actually green",7,2022-02-28 17:52:00

wallstreetbets,POV: you enabled options trading 48 hours ago,t26wfo,"i once had a conversation with a finance major friend of mine who is much smarter about this stuff than i am he said that money the economy and everything else is governed by only two things the amount of physical calories it takes to produce something whether that be energy from human expenditure fuel of some sort pack animals whatever and the collective human perception of value that’s it energy spent and value perceived if everybody wanted to right now humans can decide that assets belonging to wealthy people were suddenly value less i understand that it’s a lot more complex because they wrap their assets into  the system in an attempt to make it so that if we try to fuck them over the system itself gets fucked over but in practice it’s entirely feasible for someone to look at someone else and say “your money doesn’t exist because we all say it doesn’t“

conversely it’s entirely feasible for a group of people to collectively say “this money now has value because we all see it does“ that’s precisely what happened with many different countrieshttpsenmwikipediaorgwikiredenomination when they rebuilt their economy inflation was going off the charts but they simply rebooted their system very cleverly and suddenly there economy was stable again because people trusted the value of their new currency

so yes in practice at least in part what this person is saying is absolutely true what theyre missing of course is the fact that labor fuel water electricity and other very basic things have a literal energy cost acquainted with them in fact maybe that’s how we should measure things in the economy based on how much energy and time it took to produce something rather than other more arbitrary ways",11,2022-02-27 01:22:44

time in market  timing the market

xb

ill explain

xb

first you talk about war  those who have a lot of time in the market knew the market was going to rocket once the actual fighting started  go back and look at my comment history  i called the bottom within  minutes and the bottom for the record was at about  in the morning not during the session  i proclaimed i was going to be buying the shit out of the market that day   as a matter of fact the market was only down as much as it was because it took so long for it to begin  i might do a saturday roundtable on this with some historical graphs but the gist re the ukraine situation is this

xb

first ukraine has a total gdp that is less than that of amds market cap  its not a significant country  therefore any incursions to it unless it brought a lot of other nations into the conflict wasnt going to be able to move the needle much

xb

more importantly than that everybody knew something was going to go down weeks in advance   historically speaking almost no armed conflicts result in a drop in the stock markets over any period of time  the only exception was  because nobody saw it coming and even that resulted in a significant upswing before the market effectively nosedived the following march

even beyond that war has historically always been good for the economy  thats why they call it wartime economy  producers of everything in a wartime economy are producing at the absolute maximum capacity they possibly can  and governments are buying these products at any price  during the course of the conflict itself  war to be blunt is good for business  always has been  you think it shot up on thursday  bitch had dear leader not been such a coward that turns his back on his friends and actually helped instead of just watching youd have seen the greatest rally in the history of wall street and it would have gone on for months

xb

so your theory that invasion has to be bad was correct from the human element but wildly inaccurate from a historical element  had you had more time in the market you would have known this  as it stands youve learned a valuable lesson and a tool to put in your belt for the next time  because there will be a next time

xb

xb

xb

now lets move on to other misconceptions you had  zomg inflation

xb

inflation is bad for business that much is certain  but one thing you have to stop to consider is that when inflation is the result of creating too much currency and devalues that currency as weve done in americaits not just the cogs that goes up  prices of companies should in most cases go up in relation to inflation because the companies arent worth any less relative to the value of a dollar it just takes more dollars to get to that same equivalent value  if youve never been through a period of large inflation or read about it since youd have to have been trading during the carter administration to have seen something that even approaches the level of ineptitude dear leader has displayed so far youll likely get this wrong  now youve seen it

moving on to the other popular one  interest rates  have a bit more legs to them but still are misguided  adding interest when rates are     sure that can have a deflationary effect and really harm growth  but moving up a few basis points with a goal of  in a couple of years time  getting to  at the end of the day isnt going to move the needle all that much for most companies  especially since most are sitting on record levels of war chests  youre correct if your instinct is to bet downwards based on rising rates though retarded if you listen to idiots at jpm and cs try to outdo each other with their prediction of how many hikes there will be  one of them is predicting  now this year i think when everybody has made it very clear its  this year  and maybe  next year  maybe  what youre seeing here is not you being right that rising rates are going to tighten the markets belt but rather the investment bankers throwing a temper tantrum hence why you hear the phrase taper tantrum and using it as a cheap stage prop to brute force move the markets lower after theyve taken short positions

i would say most bloomberg users also just use  of all the functions and tools bloomberg is providing since its all the way from news fixed income fx equity pricing models

another thought on the price keep in mind that a single employee probably cost a bank at least k usd per month for salary it back office costs and not to forget office space going into tens of tousands of dollars for higher paid ones
the extra k per month for bloomberg is just a little extra and its worth it

even though its how most of you apes came to infest this sub this isnt a place to get free stock pitches or manipulate the markets by piling into someone elses short squeeze aka pump and dump its a place to hangout and talk about stocks post ridiculous bets brag about gains and commiserate about losses make your own actionable advice sub if you want or sign up for the motley fool jim cramers investment club or some other source of moronic market wisdom

 “germany to produce  green energy by  instead of  thanks to putin”

 “zelensky says ukraine will meet with russia for peace talks bro hold”

this is all useful information if you cant come up with your own bet based on it youre too stupid for this sub the bar is low but its not that low

 if you didn’t put your money on the table you have no skin in the game and therefore have zero credibility as a trader or in finance

no one here has any credibility all screenshots can be faked even if theyre real theres a solid chance someone is trying to manipulate you into picking up their bags even if theyre earnest by the time you execute on a given trade its almost certainly priced in trading requires you not just to be right but to be first this independent mentality is the big difference between the million or so people who hung out here before gme and the  million or so who joined afterwards

the only thing ill give you is that most of the daily thread comments over the last few days have been talk about ukraine and russia without any connection to finance specifically i mean the ones that are just criticizing trump or biden in relation to ukraine technically theyre about politics and should be removed from this sub that being said when theres a major news event like this one it completely takes over wall street investment firms financial news outlets and pretty much everyone talks about politics above all i think its fine for a week or two while this is on everyones mind",21,2022-02-28 23:00:04

medium to long term this means little for the general market this is not wwiii buy the dip fs

 starting in vietnam jumping to the first gulf war and again jumping to afghanistan skips a number of significant conflicts what about yom kuppur soviet invasion of afghanistan panama bosnia to name a few 
 conflicts may be a contributing factor to macroeconomics but rarely are a dominant one this is especially true with isolated expeditionary interventions also conflicts may be more a reflection of the state of an economy ie look at these evil guys trying to kill you and forget about you own dismal finances  
 this ignores the broader economic context consider that the second gulf war started near the bottom of the dot com bust see point  the ensuing rally had little to do with the conflict

latvia estonia lithuania the baltics are all similar to ukraine they all have populations of ethnic russians that could be used the same way donbascrimea were used against ukraine  and those ethnic russian populations are generally prorussia more than their baltic homes

russia would send infiltrators and declare independent republics out of a city or two in those countries backed by several thousand green mennonflagged military and use that to take the baltics over to create a land bridge to kaliningrad

putin would be able to easily just round up the baltics then possibly finland and after ukraine hed go for moldova

after that poland is just sitting there as the ussrs greatest prize other than east germany

and youd have a rebuilt russian empire  nato expansion basically the only thing preventing all that",26,2022-02-24 06:12:50

the sequence here is that apples privacy settings have cut fb off from a lot of value in personalized advertising that was genuinely new information and it is a big deal

zuckerberg and company are also aware of two other factors

 the fb audience is old and stagnant and when it comes to advertising growth youth really matters
 the fb brand had become politically toxic google did something similar with alphabet

fbs problem isnt caused by a bet on meta rather meta is the strategy to answer the problem caused by apple politics and demographics its an answer that they forged out of their own technical aspirations and it can work but it should be understood not as some unforced change but rather the response to exogenous challenges

it seems like people were initially excited about the metaverse it was only when the recent quarter revealed the core business was starting to erodefacing increasing competitionissues that people turned on the idea of spending billions and billions on something that was a giant gamble from the start facebook went overnight from being viewed as a relatively stable get and forget fang member and the metaverse on top to being viewed as a gamble that may be more reliant than people thought on a massively expensive gamble 

are facebook ready to take a loss while the metaverse is being built or do you think they will soon announce the closure of the project 

i think theres a lot of shareholders who saw facebook as one thing and now see it as another that clearly arent willing to go along for the ride i would be surprised if facebook stops the project

did meta actually have a solid business plan for this investment

i guess i have the metaverse in mind as a significant evolution of sandbox online games taking a lot of elements of what has made those games so successful and significantly expanding upon them and if they can do that and make it compelling could certainly do well can you take a massive sandbox not revolving around a game like gta o and make it more about a hangout with some fun light activities and make that compelling enough to stick around and return again and again i dont know but im also not long fb if they can the business is lucrative for the same reason online games are today  probably considerable amounts of microtransactions theres tons of metaverserelated news continuing from disney nike and others  they clearly see this as yet another opportunity to sell people the same things only this time digital versions if the metaverse is successful its definitely definitely not only going to be facebook that benefits so if im nike or other such companies i want to see this be a huge success",9,2022-02-22 11:13:17

you need to do your own due diligence i dont give investment advice and when one makes a seven figure trade the due diligence is pages long but ill add just a few notes

they havent even monetized whatsapp which has b reach in the world im not sure americans understand how reliant places like india and brazil are on whatsapp you literally order food get a cab and speak with your doctor via whatsapp its essentially a public utility for most of the world and it continues to grow yet the money faucet hasnt been turned on there is likely tens of billions yet to be tapped into here

threats of tiktok were overstated intentionally reels isnt yet monetized instagram continues to grow growth of blue facebooks core product were in line its gotta saturate at some point yes ios  privacy changes hurt but there are ways of aggregating data on the backend using personal identifiers as a way of building your ad profile this will take time but they will continue to grow despite what legendary sandbagger cfo wehner says and keep in mind meta doesnt sell your data they sell targeting people love to misquote this and the talent they have at the company my god is the best in the valley

lastly i dont care if you love him or hate him zuck will go down as one of the greatest capital allocators of all time buying instagram for b and which is now worth well over b buying whatsapp for a paltry b which essentially owns messaging worldwide and is the worlds communication utility except for the us which they are trying to break into did you see the ads during the afc championship game and now the metaverse google and microsoft are bleeding top talent to meta to build the metaverse which will be capex heavy for years meta is lightyears ahead in this space and dont get it twisted  while you may not use the metaverse gen z will in ways they already are and they will spend money in it it is the future whether you like it or not

i know a decent amount of people that have a questquest and none of them use it regularly its something you show off to friends when they’re over and mess around with playing superhot for half an hour sure going to work in a vr headset no thanks that sounds like a fucking nightmare

meta is competing for your time and they need mass adoption meta has a lot of money and people but it remains to be seen if rd can advance to the point where everyone is willing and able to wear a headset for  hours a day they already sell the devices at a loss which is fine but there’s still not any must have software  besides a couple games 

even besides that headsets are uncomfortable not everyone can use one without getting motion sickness or headaches not everyone has the space to be able to use one properly people don’t trust meta with their data but do trust competitors like apple everyone has a smart phone and can justify that as a necessary purchase not everyone can justify a vr headset 

all that being said i think they have the opportunity to create something really cool but it just seems all hype and no substance its a gimmick coincidentally all the crypto bros i know are super sold into meta",6,2022-02-22 15:47:54

heres some info on what can be done beyond the simple a to b transfers of funds with cryptonetworks

if we leave defi and nfts out of the equation for now what can be done with it

digital fraud protection rentals

networks with their own blockchain like bitcoin can essentially let other faster cheaper to use systems called layer networks pay in btc or eth or whatever to rent digital fraud protection which allows them to bootstrap new decentralized networks at a fraction of a fraction of the original networks infrastructure security and electrical costs while still inheriting important security guarantees from the layer network 

one example would be the lightning network

another example would be microsofts opensource ion nodes which provide global decentralized identity services and which pay the btc network in btc in exchange for allowing them to write synccheckpoints to the ledger which can be used to sync ion nodes around the world and guarantee that any random ion node on earth contains only valid identity data

essentially a good network system is like a trustworthy public datastore with security guarantees built into the structure there are some really cool digital security things that can be done when individuals each have their own publicprivate keypairs address  sending keys for the address

one example might be an anywhere singlesignon account that isnt tied to a google or facebook account that gathers data on every site you use the account to signin on and where you dont lose access to your favorite sites if you close your fb account or whatever",18,2022-02-22 17:21:19

the fed showed great “ability to effect change” to use your phrase though the cost of killing inflation was a deep recession you could hardly call the fed’s behavior “inaction”

investing,Why is tech going up today?,t0jd24,"posted this in another thread on here but im going to paste it here since its also relevant

let me introduce to you this little concept called sell the news

okay that being said i still think this likely will go down further but thats a longer term view markets do weird shit in short term timespans and tend to be more reflective of whiplash effects market positioning sentiment etc ive lost count of how many times people have posted here about the market not reacting like the think it should be thats not how markets have ever worked and i wouldnt ever assume markets to be rational or efficient especially in the short run

if youre looking at this purely from a fundamental perspective you need to ignore day price effects and swings day time frames are just not compatible with fundamental investing

if you want the likely explanation of why we are rallying here is my personal take which is just an opinion

 markets have been hedging for this risk for the better part of  weeks if not longer so now that its happened the hedgers and wouldbe sellers have already sold this leaves a lopsided positioning effect where those who are hedged take profits on their options or short positions and people who have sold no longer have extra positions to sell off in bear markets this effect is why you get violent squeezes after selloffs 
 the press conference announcing sanctions was likely less extreme than markets expected markets were likely expecting more sanctions on energy which would have caused havoc for both russia and europe with no major announced sanctions on energy supply going to europe the focus is simply on russian banks and other financial intermediaries this is a strong sanction but still less than what was expected given full swift cutoff was a possibility
 i would wager the most significant pain is occurring coming from institutions and funds that hold russian or ukrainian sovereign debt which has taken massive drops this along with volatility rising forces deleveraging and derisking which comes on both the long and short side firms that balance longs against shorts have to actively buy back short positions and then sell long positions to degross their book hence why you often get these big factor rotations like what weve seen today where everything that was great for the last few weeks is suddenly bright red where the losers have suddenly rallied significantly in this instance there was massive positioning into financials and energy and to an extent value factor since the start of the year that is getting unwound a bit here",13,2022-02-24 20:36:54

investing,"Is the S&P 500 still overpriced? CAPE PE says it is, but, why should I use that and not a forward PE?",t09j6f,"hi  finance analyst here

forward pe does not tell you what the present value of future earnings is it tells you what the future expected premium is and as a buyer you dont want to be buying in a rising forward pe environment because that suggests you are paying more and more for the same or less earnings

there are certain metrics like cape and like price to fair value that can tell you in a single metric that the hunch about the market getting disproportionately overpriced is a fair assessment heres why

companies forecast earnings all the time  they generate earnings all the time   the reason cape exists is to temper our tendency to accept a drifting mean  but it also tells us whether or not those forecasts have been materializing over the long term

if there is a premium in quarter  for beating earnings and a premium in quarters  through  for beating earnings and every quarter thereafter into the future or the past why should that premium keep increasing  this signals that real growth g is not increasing in proportion to return on capital r

in other words cape is already a ratio if it gets larger then the premium is increasing faster than earnings  thats what you want as a seller not as a buyer

to expand on this

its not so much the metric you should be looking at its the direction and magnitude of change in that metric over time

in finance we tend to look at multiple metrics to among other reasons make sure we arent just picking the one that favors our desired outcome or rationalizes our biases

if forward pe is growing over time that doesnt necessarily mean the company is growing  conversely if forward pe gets lower over time it can mean that the company is delivering more actual growth than stock price appreciation

it means that in the future the premium for the same earnings will be higher and we expect that because time value of money price to fair value is a better indicator of the premium for future earnings because it is discounted to present value

ideally you want a company like berkshire that promises and delivers actual growth and therefore its price to fair value remains relatively constant within a fairly narrow window year after year

if you were to compare forward pes you would likewise see more deviation of price from earnings because really in the last five decades the market has been clocking in a  annualized growth in earnings so if price is growing more than  then we know it is not tracking proportionally

and we can also see this reflected in price to fair value market to gdp and a variety of other metrics that tell us that the market is indeed overpriced or to more completely explain the expression overpriced relative to what we know that the return on capital r is accelerating at a rate disproportionate to actual economic growth g and this eventually leads to unstable economic conditions for a variety of reasons

investing,"Is the S&P 500 still overpriced? CAPE PE says it is, but, why should I use that and not a forward PE?",t09j6f,"tldr major drivers of high cape and forward pe are low interest rates  yield seeking dont expect these ratios to stay high given possible rate hikes to counter inflation

from what i understand theres more to consider than just forward pe and cape

buffett httpsarchivefortunecommagazinesfortunefortunearchiveindexhtm  
so i come back to my postulation of  growth in gdp and remind you that it is a limiting factor in the returns youre going to get you cannot expect to forever realize a  annual increasemuch less in the valuation of american business if its profitability is growing only at  the inescapable fact is that the value of an asset whatever its character cannot over the long term grow faster than its earnings do

my takeaway here is we should assume aggregate market growth will be equal to gdp eg  and not a higher forecast growth figure exception being when you pick an individual high growth stock instead of the index

seth klarman  margin of safety book  
at times when interest rates are unusually low however investors are likely to find high multiples being applied to share prices investors who pay these high multiples are dependent on interest rates remaining low but no one can be certain they will

given the risk of continued inflation im not confident that interest rates will stay low the recent  inflation was predominantly driven by an increase in energyfuel prices and with the possible decline in russias fuel exports to us im guessing fuelprice driven inflation will continue

inflation will lead to higher rate hikes forcing npv valuation discount rates to be higher and thus pe multiples to be lower going forward  even if forecast earnings expectations are met",5,2022-02-25 09:23:11

however by fall of  markets were working again spx hitting ath again bond market was stabilized and working well at that time one could make an argument that was the time to start to taper their open market operations qe because it was no longer needed

however hind site is   the reasoning of the fed was target inflation was  however  was also sort of the upper limit they allowed inflation to get so if  was the upper limit  but also the target you never hit the  so many thought this was too aggressive and letting inflation run hotter for a bit it would improve the labor market maybe improve lower wage workers that had been largely left behind

however the stock market valuation isnt really part of the fed mandate  i guess one could argue it may affect price stability but i think the fed is more concerned with consumer staples and the bond market not really the stock market

drops like we’re experiencing now will always end and then go back to where they were the problem is predicting how long the sell off continues until markets bottom out before recovery begins and then the recoveryclimb back duration can also take time for example 

 the great depression in  after the sp reaches its peak the index continues to drop for several years before it reaches the bottom the recovery begins but sp doesn’t get back to  levels for decades 
 collapse of bretton woods oil crisis etc  sp reached its peak in early  and the sell off began bottom wasn’t reached until autumn  recovery began and sp didn’t get back to  levels until 

since then we’ve had a mixture of crashes and recoveries with some being short and sharp eg march  where volatility and subsequent recovery occurred in a matter of months massive outlier 

 was the last real financial crisis and again long and painful  bottom wasn’t reached for best part of  years and it wasn’t until  we saw the sp get back to the previous high seen in  

that’s why the best strategy is dollar cost averaging especially if you’re risk averse and never forget that that the blue chips of any index constantly change two decades from now apple and amazon could theoretically be distant memories  this why an index fund is your best bet as they rebalance the fund regularly to account for this",19,2022-02-24 14:36:49

the theory behind investing in stocks is that its supposed to lead to a steady stream of dividend payments ad infinitum which encourages shareholders to hold the stock for the long term as a business participant

nowadays the most wellknown names in the stock market are almost all technology companies which have a different culture of being absolutely paranoid about their business prospects ie creative destruction and so hold on to massive amounts of cash to prepare for whatever may come in the future  these companies almost uniformly do not give out dividends  instead their selling point is that they have massive economies of scale and stand to benefit the investor by reinvesting any and all profits back into the business",78,2022-02-27 17:48:01

that said you can sell a cc on your real estate holdings or buy a call on other peoples real estate if you want to

assume you bought the house to live in it and you were worried the price would go down  you could sell somebody else an option on that house  they will get any appreciation above a mark you two agree on and you will get a flat up front payment

if you set the mark at your buy price and the price of the house goes up you will still get your whole initial purchase price plus the amount you were initially paid for the option  thats more than you spent and if the premium was high enough and the increase small enough still maybe a loss for the option buyer  its maybe worse for you than if you hadnt sold the option though if the sell price is high enough

however ive recently realised that the long term is also quite risky   


firstly for the ultra long term of  year  beyond many things could change from technological disruption to lifestyle changes eg how blackberry phones got eliminated by iphones kmarts downfall kodak etc

xb

even alibaba a favourite among fund managers due to it being a proxy to chinas tremendous growth had its share price battered terribly recently due to unfavourable news arising from its governments actions 

 

my point is buying  holding long term is not necessarily a sure win one still has to monitor the companys finances  whether any major changes had happened to the business

investing,Why does war affect the stock prices of unrelated companies? Details inside.,t0d2pe,"markets often sell off as a whole when bigger risk occurs this is nothing new 

as for whether war affects these companies well i wouldnt be so sure people are pricing in risk here and while these marijuana companies are not selling their product to people in eastern europe that does not mean they are entirely unaffected

here are some possible things youre not considering

 war and risk cause reduced likelihood of banks taking on risk by lending to firms of any given type this means that the ability to roll over loans and get financing becomes more difficult increasing liquidity risk and potential for default 
 the firms who invest in these companies are pulling their  away due to potential margin calls elsewhere ie the need to sell stocks in a portfolio to compensate for big losses is often a contributor towards market days where everything is correlated and goes in the same direction
 war risks cause significant changes in commodity pricing which can have impacts on agricultural companies which include marijuana companies for example ukraine is one i believe the worlds largest producer of nitrogen and potash which are necessary components in producing fertilizer with the conflict that means fertilizer prices which are already high are possibly going to skyrocket even higher in the future which will notably impact ag prices for more discretionary agricultural products like weed this likely will just eat into their margins 
 when risk in markets or geopolitics happens this often affects consumption and consumer behavior at a very high level this tends to result in people spending less on luxury items and increasing their savings i would say that this is likely not a positive for selling weed although you could probably argue that it may behave more like alcohol and food products which typically maintain demand even in periods of risk

im sure there are a lot of other things as well the main thing to note is that markets are very complex and just because there arent direct effects doesnt mean companies are completely unaffected and regardless stock prices change independent of fundamentals especially over shorter time periods based on sentiment and belief of future earnings stock prices in the short run are not nearly as connected to fundamentals are many people believe",10,2022-02-24 18:21:21

i dont agree that fed will not attempt to fight inflation though its too much of a political landmine now republicans will hammer democrats for year on it if they dont make a serious effort they will raise into a recession

the main thing im worried about in medium term is that the fed will use declining yoy numbers to justify more inaction but structural inflation is looking to get worse as the transitory factors ease",12,2022-02-22 06:58:56

RobinHood,Can I use my margin is cold hard cash,t36lfz,"short answer yes you can enable margin spending somewhere under margin settings

long answer you can spend it like cash but that doesn’t change the fact that it’s not cash it’s margin this is exactly the same thing as going to your bank getting an  loan and spending it as if it’s a work bonus no matter what happens that k plus interest needs to be paid back if you happened to pick  great stocks you might be able to cover your margin with future gains but otherwise you’re gonna end up on the front page of wsb with a margin call

either way this is a bad idea",8,2022-02-28 16:58:34
