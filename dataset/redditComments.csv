wallstreetbets,The 'Big Short 2' is gonna be lit,ul3ne1,but i heard an interview with some economist that this housing bubble is different than  that one was caused due to giving huge loans to people who couldn’t pay investing firms used it as a way to make profit on typically a safe investment but they got greedy after  a lot of trades and construction workers lost their jobs and found work elsewhere new home builds basically stopped for  years and then when it resumed a lot of the workers were gone so new home builds haven’t been meeting demand i think the person said the us is like  million homes short also the investors changed things up rather than giving stupid loans to people they instead bought up the properties and are renting them out so rather than flipping homes and mortgages for profit they are flipping renters it’s basically a steady very low risk income for them they keep the property make a percentage each month on it and there is a huge surplus of renters as long as the renter stays they are collecting a steady percentage of profit each month the rest of us those looking to own and not rent are what is driving up the prices we are competing with the large investing firms and other home seekers loans are not going to as risky if a group like before the people with bad credit can rent so it’s not the same as  bubble,324,2022-05-08 19:43:33

wallstreetbets,The 'Big Short 2' is gonna be lit,ul3ne1,"the  housing crash preceded by the subprime mortgage bubble is not predictive of what is happening now  this is not a subprime mortgage issue or even an issue of real estate being overvalued

your tldr is that the rise in housing prices is a mix of devaluation of the dollar compounded by a crunch on supply as people and organizations with money are trying to inflationproof their assets by buying real estate with cash

your dollar is being devalued and something will have to make it more valuable to drive down real estate prices unless something like crazy lending shenanigans is happening behind the scenes  this does not appear to be the case

that kind of major reshuffling of investments can be pretty long lasting and downward corrections may be minor when prices finally level out to a more typical annual growth rate",83,2022-05-08 19:38:06

lately last  months starting in around march we started to see fewer offers… don’t get me wrong there are still offers just not as much i’d say about  offers still… 

the point i’m trying to make is that we’ve seen less offers but there are still a lot of offers coming in… i don’t know if its because of our business model where we sell houses with good electrical and plumbing we don’t do much on cosmetics ie flooring or paint we sell on the integrity of the structure of the house  thing is certain that is happening based on what we are seeing the housing market has less willing buyers at the current prices but we are not seeing a slow down on the number of houses we can sell…

edit also revenue is the worst metric to compare as well  all this graphic states is that oems are absolutely shit when it comes to making profits from cars  tesla makes half of toyotas profit on  of their volume  capex efficiency like woah

one contains only a few drops of water the other one is almost full

the game is to bet on which bottle has more water at the end of the month casual observers walking by the table see bets on the empty bottle vastly outsize the full bottle not noticing the drip or the hole and laugh at what looks like sheer desperation from the participants

the rate of change is imperceptible until you either take a closer look or watch from a distance long enough to see the change happen only those who take a closer look will walk away richer however

while there is alot of hype and future expectation in the stock i think its fair to say tesla has been steadily scaling for a while now regardless of comparative fundamentals 

their goal is to sell  million vehicles by  last year they produced k if we can roughly estimate a x on their current earnings well see if your calculator can spit that out

the same job responsibilities and impact to the company 
 when i graduated high school was paying k
  years later graduated college and its k
 after  years of grad school the job is k
 current day that role is starting at k

it makes no sense cause everything just costs more anyways so my  k and my  k both result in a paycheck to paycheck life style 

this system we live in sucks",41,2022-05-09 16:28:56

i’ve thought it may have been better if i was not here as she would not have to work so hard for the money i throw literally into the trash everyday but the only thing that prevented me from doing so is that i couldn’t bear knowing that had i done so i would be the reason for the sadness to come

now after losing k of my mothers money and actually learning about the market and making trades of my own i’m only down k although it’s not ideal it is progress things do get better

wallstreetbets,Bill Gates says there's a 'strong argument' we're about to see a global economic slowdown,ulqh91,"the housing market has purposefully been put out of reach of more and more people this is just a function of capitalism which if you ignore the absolutely horrendously convoluted definitions is actually just a system designed to concentrate capital in the hands of the few every time theres a crash and recessions the people with all the money buy up the land crashes are a part of their wealth accumulation the idea that theyre a failure of the system is naive theyre a core foundation of the system and the single biggest driver of the wealth transfer from the many to the few its not a bug 

we already went through this is  when  not banks  were offering ridiculous introductory rates knowing that the buyer could never afford the actual payments everyone involved in that grift made their fortunes and then the cost of fixing it not just the capital cost but the emotional cost was passed on to the average person who is purposefully excluded from participating in this type of grift this marked the beginning of modern monetary policy which is to say it was the moment the wealthiest realised they could have their cake eat it and then shit on the rest of the population 

we now live in a society where the oligarch class have taken directly taken almost all of the species combined wealth and are using it to expand that wealth gap to the point it can never be reduced the end goal is pretty clear to me  a landed gentry class who leases land to the peasant class and parcels out the minimum amount of money to pay that lease and not starve to death when the inevitable happens and the vast majority of jobs have been automated the peasants will quite literally be living under the same circumstances peasants in the middle ages were  you cant own land you cant decide what you do and you absolutely cant increase your wealth you will be given a pod to live in given a stipend forced to consume the products of half a dozen companies and forced to adhere to social norms via social credit scores which are absolutely coming to the west at first in the form of incentives and then in the chinese form

wallstreetbets,Tesla sells just 52 cars in Australia in April vs 1472 running monthly average for 2022,uk8kiy,"i have a small bet against tesla here are some of the reasons  


 just months ago you was able to order a model and have it delivered within month the delivery time atleast in norway and alot of eu countrys are now months with increase price on everything and people are not sure whats going to happend i think people are not going to buy a new car  months ahead of time  


the price of  a tesla have gone up and the usd have strenghten itself against many other currencys the last months so that is going to be a double whammy and i think they will increase the price even more in germany they increase the price on model from  to  euro in april  


tesla is a premium care but what you need to understand is that alot of countries not us subsides electrical cars so basicly i can buy  tesla model for the same price i can get a bmw  series gasdiesel  model  so alot of people have bought tesla that dont realy afford it because electricity is cheaper and interest is low but now interest is going up and electricity price in europe is high a tesla cost around x a normal yearly income in the areas tesla sells there care if the interest rates go to  you basicly end up paying x montly income just in interest rate on your car loan  


tesla had in  car loans subsides with interest as low as  in many countries you dont see them anymore and that not just tesla it was many car companies doing that these loans usually had  years before going over to market rate  


we have all read whats going on in china its not normal people that buy teslas in china but i dont realy see the sale booming this year  


so i think the number of cars sold will be fare less then expected this year",18,2022-05-07 11:56:55

investing,Anyone else find this downturn legitimately depressing?,ulvwmh,"its the risk you take when in the market  short term burn sucks but in time it should pay off you havent lost anything unless you sell something for a loss so lets be clear there i owned a biotech therapeutics stock that went from  down to  and i just held  fast forward  years after getting flooded out of my home losing my job getting another job  that company i was all in with ended up getting bought out for  and i bought my house with the proceeds



so the point is ive been here the depression is an emotional response which if you listen to will make you lose even more money go read about buddhism or mindfulness  this is your life now the market might very likely even go lower but you cant time it you could sell today and market could rip tomorrow  its unlikely but unless you are keeping up with all the different meetings and upcoming events that could impact the market in one direction or the other you might as well just hold where you are at


ive already harvested my k loss for the year and was able to buy in what i thought was a bottom for spot but here we are today it is what it is i dont need this money right now it would be nice to get a bigger house but i make decent money so i can still pay all my expenses and buy more stocks the lower they go



you me and many others have probably been swooned by the fomo and that is why we are where we are with chaos comes opportunity beautiful beautiful opportunity keep buying stocks your buddies who are blowing it on luxuries are enjoying short term fun  i plan on having way cooler shit than my peers because i invested in the long run it happened with my house happened with my vehicles",60,2022-05-09 17:16:58

here are some thoughts to give you some perspective

   it’s better to invest and learn with small amounts of money that matter to you now  if k is meaningful to you now then learn to invest that money  understand your own psychology how you make decisions and learn to invest  if you get to the point where k later in your life has the same meaning as k now as in your make a lot more in the future investing that k is not going to be any easier bc you never went through the process of investing now…basically what i’m saying is learn while the dollar amounts are small  

  you saved your sacrificed and you invested  the other option was fancy clothes dinners “toys” and upgraded gadgets  all of those are consumable…they will eventually have a value of zero  at least this way you sit on it and it grows over time and you can recoup your loses  

  you learned to sacrifice and save  this will have value for you later in life  when life throws you a curve ball you will be ready to deal with it  the same can’t be said for the guygirl who is too focused on acquiring things to make themselves look rich

investing,Is investing based on the speculation of infinite growth?,ujmcdq,"its a deeper question than you realise and it really requires a lot of reading to fully understand 

since economic growth began after the industrial revolution it has been sustained before the industrial revolution there was no concept of economic growth a population growing in wealth would end up growing in population to even it out so economic improvements in the s would make the population larger but keep everyone at the same wealth level

this is because pre industrial revolution the world was malthusian  adding subsistence just added to growth until populations would grow too big and disease would lower the number 

what the industrial revolution brought was rapid and constant improvements in efficiency and productivity you did not need to increase workers and input materials to increase output instead a new invented machine would allow you to use the same number of workers or less and the same amount of input  but get more output 

the economy stopped being zero sum you didnt need to wait for half the population to die to get more money suddenly economies could grow and become positive sum 

unfortunately over the last thirty or more years corporations have changed it so that all improvement from productivity and efficiency go to them and ceos 

but in theory economic growth is sustainable because its theorised that technology will advance until we get to what is called post scarcity  resources will be so abundant we dont need to worry about it 

so tldr  as long as technology progresses efficiency and productivity will improve and growth will continue",51,2022-05-06 13:02:37

investing,What's the difference between ETFs and index funds?,ulicru,"a fund is a generally a basket of stocks  they come in two main forms  mutual funds and etfs exchange traded funds

mutual funds are their own sort of thing  they dont have intraday pricing trades usually take a day to settle etc  theyre fine  often found in retirement accounts where youre just throwing more and more money at a fund every two weeks or every month whatever

etfs are bundled up to look like a stock so they have a stock ticker  you can buy and sell them just like stocks but underneath theyre a basket of stocks just like a mutual fund

since theyre splitting up money among many companies they tend to have lower downside risk than individual stocks  one dude at one company cooking the books cant wipe them out  however they generally have less upside as well because one company that explodes cant make their value go up   they still have all the systemic risks since theyre often invested in stocks  

that said some funds invest things other than stocks bonds commodities money markets derivatives you name it  their risks will obviously be different  

index funds in mutual or etf form is just about what they invest in  an sp  index fund will buy the stocks in the sp  weighted according to size market cap  their returns will mirror what the sp  index does with very small amounts of error for overhead rebalancing etc  there are other indexes like the dow jones russel  etc  there are also indexes specific to sectors of the market or geographical areas or precious metals or other commodities whatever

since index funds are just algorithmically buying what the index has and rebalancing on occasion they tend to have low overhead expenses  especially large ones since the overhead cost is split among way more dollars

some other funds again mutual or etf form have actual fund managers who are picking what stocks to buy  these tend to have higher expense ratios because youre funding teams that actually do research and try to make smart investing decisions  however their performance has generally not always been worse than a simple index fund

i should also mention that some mutual funds can have weird shit like load they take a percentage of your money right off the top  they may also have minimum buyin etc  thats becoming less common over time but its definitely still around with more niche funds

another thing about funds is some of them are closedend funds  they raise a specific amount of money by selling a specific number of shares in their ipo then they never issue more shares and if you want to sell them you need somebody to buy them from you  that could be at a premium or a discount  this is in contrast to openended funds which simply take your money and give you new shares when you buy in then cash you out when you sell  index funds will pretty much always be open ended funds and closed end funds tend to be things that invest in other things like municipal bonds or utilizing leverage so they cant just cash people out whenever  

tldr  

if you dont know what youre doing youre probably looking for open ended broad index funds with no load no fees and low overhead expenses  the etf vs mutual fund format really doesnt make all that much difference

if you kind of know what youre doing you can look at narrower openend funds eg emerging markets or tech or growth or value with low overhead expenses

be wary of funds that charge fees have high overhead are closed ended or have load  they arent necessarily bad but you need to know what youre signing up for",400,2022-05-09 05:03:41

investing,Why you're not going to see 99% bearishness at the bottom,ujomsc,"my perspective is that sentiment is super important on intermediate timeframes but for bigger dips  ie recessions structural issues causing market declines must be resolved first given some of the problems that markets take on are caused by excess risktaking when sentiment is extremely strong 

in our current environment i believe a lot of the problem is that there is forced deleveraging occurring which occurs as a product of rising interest rates rising volatility and falling stock prices its a procyclical feedback loop that works both ways this typically gets short circuited by the fed changing policy stance which hasnt occurred yet and im not certain that the fed will change policy until they start to see blowup risk becoming all too real until something literally blows up until we start getting inflation prints declining in a significant manner or until we start seeing signs growth is falling off a cliff the risk here is that the fed typically waits too long since theyre operating with lagging data and dont have the political ability to make moves without actually having proof that whatever  theyre trying to prevent is actually a real problem in the first place

so basically sentiment matters if you think of stocks trading within a medium term range but if the forces in place are systematically forcing selling sentiment just doesnt matter that much when it comes to picking longer term bottoms until the structure itself is forced to shift

i agree that social media is going to do what its going to do the problem is that people tend to take  views of people shouting stuff on social media and extrapolate that view as if it represents consensus in any way if you had social media in  like now you would surely have had a few people yelling shit into the falling markets as a bull but that doesnt mean it was representative of what people broadly believed in other words measuring sentiment is tricky and its not always a reliable gauge depending on where youre sourcing your views from",21,2022-05-06 14:37:36

investing,How long can we keep rates increasing to battle inflation?,ulgd1s," yes they’ll keep raising rates as long as we aren’t in a recession and there still is inflation to tame although they could keep raising rates into a recession if they decide a recession is the lesser of the two evils but recessions tend to cool inflation on their own so it’s not common practice to do so 

 there could be a huge correction or it could already be priced in up to you to decide also depends on how much they actually raise rates vs what is expected

shopify is in a different position but i imagine some of the same issues apply i dont know how much people who buy through shopify stores see it as a brand but the businesses that work with them do and they are likely facing some of the same issues we faced and arent really up to doing an inhouse solution that would work so i can see this improving their brand as a reliable way to get stuff into peoples hands

a pure home is an expense and not really an investment it could be considered an investment is if you chose to downsize at some point in the future that tends to not happen except maybe after people become empty nesters even then people tend to still buy nice places if they can

you always need a place to live and there will be payment tied to that if you sell your more expensive house and want to move to something similar in size quality and location it will cost you about the same as your house 

as others have mentioned there is some financial benefit in leverage but that isnt necessarily free you have the debt and you have to service the debt in an inflationary environment this can be good but there still is some risk to it

you can look at the benefit of purchasing a more expensive place is that you get to use it sure but you also have to pay for it and service that debt so if you were renting a place and wanted a nicer place you could benefit from it if you paid more 

when purchasing a house for living and not rental stuff find a place that you want to live in and can afford dont look at it as an investment buying a big honker place because you have some notion of how it will be a great investment rather than you wanting to live there is a mistake imo 

one of the big drawbacks of taking out more loan on a house vs the market is that you are committing future money to it in a year if your gall bladder implodes and you have to go to the hospital you cant work and insurance doesnt cover it for some weird reason you still have that stock you can sell easy with a house there you have other issueshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxgamprxv 

my second home was a duplex where i rented the other side that absolutely was an investment but it was a choice and one of the requirements for it was that it would also be a place i would be ok with living if it wasnt an investment",96,2022-05-05 11:37:04
investing,investing in stocks vs purchasing a more expensive house,uir5s6,we bought relatively cheaply with the idea in mind that if either of us is out of work the other can pay for everything with their salary it might be a struggle but we could do it if we upsized that probably wouldnt be the case,22,2022-05-05 08:48:12
investing,investing in stocks vs purchasing a more expensive house,uir5s6,"the main benefit of a house is that you get a lot of leverage eg you get x leverage with a standard  down no bank would lend this money out for stock investing even if stocks have a better yield they dont usually have x better yield

its also a way to benefit from inflation since houses usually keep pace with inflation and the debt is worth less in the future

imo if the house is in a good area with high demand the house is better if you plan on renting out a room then its an even better deal investing is tricky bc of its volatility and how easy it is to get swayed by meme momentum and end up losing money

however i wouldnt recommend over reaching w the house eg if its the most expensive house on the street with less room to grow or if it significantly increases your dependency on having a stable job",48,2022-05-05 06:53:07
investing,investing in stocks vs purchasing a more expensive house,uir5s6,more expensive house will cost more in terms of daily running cost more energy cost more council tax uk etc,21,2022-05-05 06:35:12
investing,investing in stocks vs purchasing a more expensive house,uir5s6,a larger home is a liability just like your current home stocks are investments a rental property or renting your current house is an investment if it’s paying for itself seems like your best option is stocks unless you can keep your current house rent it and it pays for your mortgage on your new house that’s the idea anyway,10,2022-05-05 10:59:59
investing,Predicting the 2023 Recession,ui7l8i,economists have not been able to come up with a way to predict a recession so its largely unpredictable,254,2022-05-04 15:28:14
investing,Predicting the 2023 Recession,ui7l8i,"this is how it works

when you see around you and in the press for a protracted period of time that businesses are laying off employees when help wanted signs start disappearing from windows when people you know are out of work not because of the great resignation but because they cant get a job and are actively looking or asking you about job opportunities

that is when the recession is happening

right now we are nowhere near that right now it is the opposite the economy is being held back by not enough willing workers and supply chain constraints the minute those things abate the economy will roar and that might not be until  but it will happen",66,2022-05-04 16:29:56
investing,Predicting the 2023 Recession,ui7l8i,"all we know right now is that the fed intends to raise interest rates to curb inflation so what does this mean for the real economy well it means debt is going to get more expensive for everyone  

all loans from business home cars credit cards are going to see increased interest rates  higher interest means more entities and people are going to get priced out of being able to buy things

maybe not now but this will lead to decreased expenditures from businesses and people

it will also expose what industries and business are exposed to large amounts of debt  not all debt is fixed rate many people and businesses have variable rate debt which will increase their interest payments in this environment

if a business had loans and was paying  interest and now was paying  their interest payments doubled  this can really hurt a business who is over leveraged

so debt is getting more expensive and a large amount of our economy is fueled by debt  it wont happen over night but increased interest rates will slow expenditures for individuals and businesses

now the fed is being transparent and is warning this happening we might avoid a recession or at least a major one if businesses and people start to adjust for what is to come",13,2022-05-04 15:08:46

investing,Trying to set my teenage daughter up for financial success.,uk559n,"setting your children up for financial success has more to do with education and attitude than just giving them money

for example my former best friend has received k for a down payment on a house  k for an emergency buffer from his parents  
right now he hasnt had a job for almost a year drinks a lot daily and the emergency buffer is almost drained  
i sometimes try to help him understand but at age  im not his father nore have the responsibility to save him from himself

my advice match whatever she can come up with herself  
in other words if she can save k for a down payment herself match that with k  
offer her guidance on etfs and long term investing and if she decides to lump sum or periodically invest wisely into diversified index funds or solid blue chip companies if shes educated in that field match that aswell

first of all the bond market has lost faith in the fed’s inflation fighting abilities  the bond market is as bad right now as i have ever seen it  the fed is going to have to protect the bond market from a disorderly collapse  if they do this stocks will rally big at least for a while

second most of the rest of the world has become a nightmare for investors  europe has a huge energy shortage and an unpredictable maniac on their doorstep  china is the new north korea  africa and south asia have a huge food problem  japan’s currency is falling apart as they commit to high future inflation  south america would be ok if they get their act together  so not much to invest in except australia and north america  the us is likely to get through this mess better than anybody else and that will support demand for dollar assets",12,2022-05-09 17:22:19

investing,Thoughts on the narrative that the growing market share of index funds is problematic?,ukgkrq,"i believe the theory is that passive investors buy index funds regardless of price which lacks price discovery  price discovery is basicaly pricing in news and opinions about the future of every stock  passive investors lack price discovery because they buy aapl regardless if its sh or sh  the claim is that too high a percentage of passive investing will break price discovery in the stock market  i have some criticisms of this view

first of all prices are determined by trading not holding  if just  of market caps change hands per day that determines stock prices  the buyers and sellers each millisecond reflect their news and views  even if  is passive the  being traded determines prices

i also question if passive investors are a monolith which all do the same thing  in a crash growth stocks have further to fall like qqq vs spy in  which means value investors tend to do better  so the passive investors with a value tilt will tend to do better than pure market index investors in a crash  theres some incentive to change strategies which is considered passive despite shifting assets into different index funds  while not happening in milliseconds this is a slow moving form of price discovery

the nyse for all its trading volume does not meet the needs of all institutional investors  one way vanguard and fidelity profit from their index funds is through institutional investors who will pay a premium to avoid placing massive orders on the market  doesnt that hinder price discovery more than passive investing  institutional investors have more money than retail investors",21,2022-05-07 18:16:16

investing,Thoughts on the narrative that the growing market share of index funds is problematic?,ukgkrq,"so i think there are two main issues that are brought up
one usually deals with some sort of efficient allocation of capital  index funds may allocate capital to some lackluster companies lets say some company was added to the sp index decades ago however recently their performance has been lackluster  an argument maybe that these companies can just float along for the ride as millions of people pour money into sp index fund these funds then go out and buy those companies  if the economy is good and people are savinginvesting a lot and just pouring funds into the sp these companies get rewarded as their stock price rises  not really because they are posting good results but just so much money is flowing into an index they are part of

second has to do with voting rights for example the large index fund providers black rockvanguard  state street may own over  of the share of almost all large companies giving them immense voting power if they should ever try to use it and its just worrisome that  firms have that much control now even if these firms have some sort of pass through voting where the people holding the funds can sort of vote on shareholder proposals on the funds they hold they may not be the best people to vote on how to run a businessmaybe they will vote with their hearts and not with their wallet and make proposals that will negatively affect companies 

i dont see these are issues myself really  ok first most people in the usa dont even bother to vote in elections will they take the time to vote on obscure share holder proposals in mass numbers i get not everyone who invests in index funds lives in the usa but you get my point

also i find it weird stock pickers bring this up one would think if index funds do not allocate capital efficiently it would now be easier to find undervalued diamonds that may not be part of the popular indexes  maybe a norwegian company is killing it but since they are not part of the popular indexes their stock isnt being rewarded as one thinks it should this is an investment opportunity and if this is true now you have a chance to invest in an great undervalued company long term if they are a great company there are ways to grow the stock price do stock buy backs issue dividends  these will eventually get the company noticed 

also lets do a thought experiment lets say index fund are outlawed or something you have to invest in individual stocks or funds with active managers who pick and choose the stocks to invest in in the aggregate these fundspeople will allocate dollars almost the exact same way index funds do because that what index funds do they just copy in aggregate how the market allocates funds to companies with some other rules",18,2022-05-07 16:57:58

lets get  thing clear these people dont care about you making money all they care about is their own popularity success and influence

from a shareholder  voting perspective i get the criticism   
you put a lot of voting power in the hands of a small group but lets face it practically none of us has enough wealth to buy ourselves into businesses with a significant  that gives us voting rights

if you look at the issues with raising rates in  and you look at whats happening now but then you realize that now the fed has no choice but to continue and bring rates up significantly to fight inflation  

so weve got significantly worse monetary policy coming than in no one disputes this but yet if the markets go back to  levels its going to be an absolute panic bloodbath because weve got another  or so to go down  its also possible this might be a slow process over many years  all while we bond yields going up and up and pull more money out of stocks and into relatively safe  returns

investing,"I want to to focus on dividends until I die. Does anyone have a general ""Can't fail"" plan for me to relax in?",uke96u,"so there’s a very important detail in your comments that’s not in your post… you want to avoid retirement accounts because you don’t want to lock your money up 

 retirement account lockups can be mitigated via a roth ladder talk to a professional 

 k is literally free money that you are missing out on if you don’t contribute at least up to the match 

 dividend focused investing in a taxable account is guaranteed to be less efficient and less profitable than growth investing 

 multiple studies have shown that even in a retirement account dividend investing is less efficient than growth investing 


now with all that being said answer this question

do you care about the dividend or do you care about maximizing your wealth 

if you care about maximizing your wealth growth investing 

if you care about paying as little in taxes as possible growth investing or dividends in retirement accounts

if you care about maximizing your wealth and paying as little in taxes as possible… growth investing in a retirement account 

if you care about getting that monthly  quarterly  yearly dividend and damn the consequences otherwise… a well diversified dividend growth etf like vanguard’s",32,2022-05-07 14:54:52

investing,Would you invest in real estate in some exotic country?,uhcfd7,"anything remote is pretty dangerous to buy into even out of state  unless you are big and willing to do whatever to get that rent money  without fully knowing what you are buying you could easily buy on the wrong side of the tracks by only a few hundred feet and not realize it until you go to rent or get your first renter

the people posting here said i would i lived there before

if you want to buy something go rent a house for a year and live there  youll meet people and find out what you like and dont like  youll start to hear about local deals vs sellers selling to just international buyers eg paying  or  times what they should probably more

if its somewhere you lived as a kid chances are the people and things you liked have massively changed or more likely youve massively changed  what was great fun when you were young suddenly looks like slum living to you today  

so move there for a year rent a house  youll overpay by x most likely because you dont know the market but it will be cheap compared to buying and having that mistake

in brazil properties can sit for  years most have  lots of properties are priced to hold not sell  someone sold to a foreigner for x what it was worth so now everyone only wants that x money   when a realtor comes to them they say sure ill sell for x the price  realtors just put it up on their site and you need to learn to wade through that crap    

it wouldnt necessarily be obvious to a foreigner as  of it is like that and never actually sells and  actually is priced properly and turns over  if you paid that x price youre stuck with it for  years if you go to sell theyll know youre an idiot and will offer you  less so they can flip it for a profit and only double their money  

you make your money when you buy not when you sell   so you need to take the time and really learn your location   

you really need to know your laws there and what rights you have  brazil has plenty of use it or lose it laws   its not that difficult for people to move onto your land and take control of it especially if you only come once every  years to look at it and then leave  if its a house theyll just break in and live there if they are there for  or  years and you come back that is a long legal battle  it might take you several years and since you arent even living there who knows what youre paying for  the realtor who said he would rent out your place might have given it to some relatives  now youre paying him to help you evict someone he put in there and hes just taking your money and their rent money

if its rural property theyll subdivided it and put  small houses on it and then sell them  suddenly you need to take  people to court maybe  people since they might have resold those properties already and they might be on their nd or rd owners  so now youre trying to prove its yours in all  of those court cases  owning land in another country isnt the same all over the world",31,2022-05-03 12:36:38

investing,Why is the risk-free rate of return often considered as the discount rate for future cash flows?,ujv01k,"look up the capm formula it explains that a combination between the risk free rate and the equity premium multiplied with the asset beta value is used to calculate the expected equity return for the asset when inflation increases it

 increases uncertainties in the market meaning investors usually require a higher equity premium to invest in equities thereby impacting high beta assets to a higher degree

 when inflation increases then the nominal interest rate risk free rate is expected to increase  assuming the real interest rate is unchanged

growth companies are usually hit the hardest as they carry a higher beta value and a higher share of the valuation comes from cash flows in eg year  and are therefore discounted harder

keep in mind all of this assumes no changes to the fundamentals eg lower macro economic activity or larger debt payments ie the valuation changes are only driven by changes to the time value of money",20,2022-05-06 20:20:49

the main reasons the diverging monetary policy is causing appreciation are

 foreign investors buying the higher yielding us government debt instead of their ownthis raises demand for dollar
 emerging market countries will suffer due to these outflows and international instability brings investors to the dollar for safety
