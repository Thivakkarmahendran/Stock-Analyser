stocks,Russia will lose their European LNG market share,syopu2,"pffff… they said that when russia responded to georgia’s aggression by invading it and annexing south ossetia and abkhazia in  they said that when putin docked half the black sea fleet off syria’s coast to thwart nato’s attempt at full scale invasion in  they said that when he annexed crimea later that year they said that when he continuously helped prop up assad through assad’s victory in the civil war he does not care about stupid sanctions and knows europe needs their energy

putin has been cucking the west for  years at least a large reason for his success has been nato’s repeated stupidity since  driving up global energy prices with bush that allowed russia to reform from a debt ridden society to a surplus nation able to arm itself again fostering a coup in georgia in  and then convincing the georgians to try and occupy parts of north ossetia in  funding losing insurrectionists in the syrian civil war while assad now more entrenched than ever became more dependentloyal to russia failing to make a deal with iran and therefore allowing that major opec chip to be a cog in the russiachina framework and not nato thus losing market share control same with venezuela funding insurrectionist in the ukraine since  without an actual plan to hold or take crimea even though it was obvious the russians would annex it immediately because of the value of sevastopol 

and now this putin is a formidable opponent but he’s going against arrogant amateurs and thus keeps taking pounds of flesh south ossetia abkhazia crimea eastern ukraine etc who’s next 

and importantly since the united states splooged  trillion losing a war against afghan goat herders and iraqi cab drivers accomplishing nothing putin knows that our military is just spent and has no desire for another more real fight

stocks,Why I’m bullish,sz34c2," interest rate hikes have been priced in at this point unless the fed does something totally unhinged the market should respond positively when the hikes start being implemented

priced in assumes the market is rational it also assumes nothing changes the fed may also need to do something unhinged if inflation expectations remain high or worsen despite tightening

 economic data is strong consumer spending gdp growth unemployment numbers etc periods of high inflation aren’t necessarily indicative of economic issues gdp contraction and unemployment are much better indicators

high inflation is fine for the markets the risk is with inflation comes rate hikes and that we may be entering an inflationary spiral which the fed will need to induce a recession to fix it its probably unlikely but we just dont know for sure how this will play out yet there are clearly a lot of extremely smart people worried about the situation we find ourselves in right now

 russiaukraine is a temporary situation ww is not going to happen i’m not staying that russia isn’t going to invade but it doesn’t pose any long term risks to the us economy

putin is becoming increasingly unhinged and it wouldnt be that hard to imagine what happened yesterday being looked back on by future generations as the catalyst for a much more serious conflict at some point russia is going to go to far and things will need to escalate to war even if it is a proxy war with the west another thing i worry about is that the sanctions cause putin to lose the support of his people i worry that putin is the kind of guy who would rather risk starting a world war in an attempt to rally the country behind him than to step down peacefully

but to your point i dont think further escalation is an immediate risk to markets i do worry over the next decade were likely to see more serious geo political risks like this play out if markets are nervous about russia and ukraine imagine how the market is going to react when china tries to take taiwan

 supply chain issues will ease as many companies have guided this and as someone who works in logistics i can tell you that the disruptions are easing

sure but i think the main risk here is that we see a wageprice spiral that persists after the supply chain issues ease

however remember that companies come and go ideas change human behavior changes innovation happens and the world can look very different very fast think sears ge ibm exxon att intel cisco gm ntt hp etc in their heyday no one ever thought that they would give up their leadership position as the top companies by market cap however companies come and go boom and bust new market leaders emerge when new generations step in no investment is ever certain and it’s never guaranteed that a market leader today will be a market leader in  years that’s why people always recommend the sp to capture companies that eventually will rise to the top

it’s possible that people will use the internet in completely different ways than we can currently imagine and conceive in today’s world who knows we may get to a point where people don’t even type on a phone or a keyboard to search information we may get to a point where people don’t use d flat surface monitors or phones in the future search engines could look completely different in the future will google spearhead a change maybe and maybe not

shorting arkk and the companies in arkk can also mean that innovation is overhyped the business opportunities are overvalued or that the market pumped too much money in one area or simply saying cathies timing is horrible

on a personal note im getting so fed up with the ukrainerussia news every day for several weeks ive been told an invasion into ukraine is imminent if it doesnt happen this week then we need to start discounting the likelihood of it happening at all im convinced putin is just doing this as leverage against nato or is trying to gauge what kind of response they might expect from the west if they ever did decide to invade ukraine seriously if hes going to invade why is he taking so long to do it i guess its kind of cool of him to give ukrainians so much time to prepare for an attack and for the west to send them arms i would have thought hed opt for the element of surprise not weeks and weeks of publicly pissing around at the border",52,2022-02-19 01:49:09

in my opinion they are honestly diversifying into more stuff because they aren’t allowed to grow as much as they wanted to in certain aspects such as commerce to increase competition net income was down on last quarters earning relative to last year and they are having to sell of assets 

they also lost interestinvestment income last quarter on some venues as china wants other competitors and i think they had to trim stuff they didn’t want to speculation basically still at the mercy of the regulatory changes which obviously affect financials nice company though",75,2022-02-21 17:25:15

stocks,'Palantir isn't a palatable stock even after its big decline'.,syvlns,"i feel really good about pltr i think a lot of the negativity surrounding the stock comes from jaded people who wanted to make a quick buck and were burned by buying at the top of the postipo phase with losses compounded by a general market turndown we will get back there but itll take a year or two or three maybe even four or five like much of our politics most negative comments are emotional rhetoric rather than factbased dialogue 

mathematically pltr is hitting or nearmissing all important earningfinancial benchmarks and guidance fundamentally pltr is building a robust moat by developing and marketing a data management and analysis ecosystem that is technologically top of the linemost advanced in the market once its software is more widely known in the commercial market i think it will very quickly start to be adopted by big name companies with complex data needs anecdotally i work in the dod ive used their software in a deployed combat environment and trust me we in the dod know about shitty computerssoftware working with palantirs software made me a believer in their quality their ability to turn seemingly disparate extremely diverse and complicated data into actionable analysesresults further i have recent comp sci  college graduate friends and during career day while the top  go to faang only the top  are even looked at and given offers to work at palantir

all this to say im bullish in the medium and longterm current market conditions are poor drops have nothing to do with individual stocks performances and so while the market is generally down i will continue dcaing further into pltr now and over the next year for clarity and sa i have  shares with a  cost average",134,2022-02-22 23:08:27
stocks,'Palantir isn't a palatable stock even after its big decline'.,syvlns,you have to believe in the company long term if you don’t believe i just wouldn’t invest in them because every single dip you will want to sell it because you won’t believe they will recover  i’m long palantir but i’m not expecting any huge gains in the short term,37,2022-02-22 22:41:46
stocks,'Palantir isn't a palatable stock even after its big decline'.,syvlns,"pltr is going through an s curve slow adoption and growth at first government contracts only and are now breaking into commercial sector nato alliance only

the share based comp dilutes the share price but it’s pretty interesting seeing the misunderstanding people have the float has gone up because the company is using its stock as a currency to pay out for talent 

the company has actually had minimal share issuance since their direct listing as a matter of fact even the sbc is slowing down year over year 

the company is m positive free cash flow no debt and has a stable foundational client with government contracts so if you think the shares will go to  then perhaps you dont understand what holding equity truly means there’s almost zero chance of bankruptcy risk where debt holders wipe equity holders and the company is taken over by debt holders because there’s no debt… 

so depending on one’s stomach for volatility you can buy and own a unique company that has the track record for execution at the highest and national security levels of demanding

this is a long hold and see how they grow their commercial side of the business the nearest competitor people assume is snowflake but snowflake might not be the one instead i believe it’s crm they are slowly taking over every silo of enterprise softwaredata crm project management slack workday via partnership etc the vision is to have a unified system where every application sends through a stream of data for analysis on one platform crm is trying to do this by being that unified vendor

i believe the opposite to be the real future that pltr foundry is the unified platform wrapping all enterprise apps and collecting the streams of data for analysis

so it’s either a  haircut not  because there’s no bankruptcy risk or a x return based on dcf modeling from these levels as the company grows through its high growth segment of s curve

people really allow price action to dictate their narrative but stock prices doesn’t always follow product development and adoption here as wallstreet analysts aren’t systems engineers eps has nothing to do with how the pltr platform is being deployed and used by new customers who signed multi million dollar deals i would change my hypothesis if i have facts that show customers are dumping the core product after several years of deployment and usage but i have not seen that quite the opposite with how sticky they are

it’s a good riskreturn bet for me but if you can’t stomach the volatility go buy goog or aapl which i also own a lot of as well",64,2022-02-22 22:28:10

over the past  years  of fund managers fell short of their sp  benchmark with  failing over  years

that means almost  beat the sp  over  years and more than  in  beat it over  years its difficult but not impossible

individual investors also have an advantage over professional fund managers as hundreds of millions or billions of dollars flow into their funds the managers are forced to buy lesser performing stocks to avoid overconcentration in their best stocks and to maintain diversification that dilutes the effects of their top performers and lowers overall performance they tend to regress to the mean

individual investors do not have that problem they can concentrate on their best performers and arent forced to buy lesser performing stocks

individual investors also have another advantage over wall street professionals as peter lynch the legendary manager of the fidelity magellan fund who beat the sp  for many years explained in his book one up on wall street

america’s most successful money manager tells how average investors can beat the pros by using what they know according to lynch investment opportunities are everywhere from the supermarket to the workplace we encounter products and services all day long by paying attention to the best ones we can find companies in which to invest before the professional analysts discover them when investors get in early they can find the “tenbaggers” the stocks that appreciate tenfold from the initial investment a few tenbaggers will turn an average stock portfolio into a star performer",54,2022-02-22 06:36:43

stocks,5 year bet - GOOG or FB,swmx1b,"i hold both

personally i think googl has the biggest moat in the faang  between its search youtube mobile os duopoly with apple and one of the big three in the cloud space plus obviously massive advertising revenue it’s heavily in favour on reddit at present as it crushed earnings and i like how many different verticals they’re trying to get into… though they’ve often fallen flat on innovations either way it’s a monster and will continue growing like one the stock split will also likely drive up the share price

sentiment is incredibly negative on fb at present and it’s always been considered like a vice stock the metaverse isn’t something i’m totally sold on though a lot of large companies are throwing rd budgets at it if it comes off fb will be wellpositioned with it as beaten down as it is i think there’s a lot of upside the headwinds of apple and google’s advertising changes remain but fb continues to turn massive profits 

declining active users on the fb platform itself is heralded as the end of days for the company but… i don’t see it while people do move on to newer platforms fb itself has been incredibly sticky as a social media platform likewise instagram remains insanely popular whatsapp may be harder to monetise but it’s got a massive active user base fb is also doing well with the oculus in the vr space my biggest criticisms are really that they could be doing more to bolster their core business reels to compete with tiktok is good but i’d like to see them capitalise more on the marketplace feature  collaboration with shopify and similar rather than having everything quite so focused on the metaverse

in short fb is the riskier play with greater headwinds but has been oversold to the point it’s got a decent amount of upside potential if it lands its metaverse gamble andor finds a way to recover some of the advertising future earnings to be lost to privacy changes it could be a really good long hold googl will likely continue to grow consistently and churn profits if it builds a moat in any of the various areas they’re focusing rd money it will be a very nice upside",104,2022-02-19 23:38:39

stocks,What triggered the Dot Com Crash?,syyutn,"i’m just gonna leave this here because no one seems to be answering your main question

nasdaq peaked on friday march  

the initial trigger is attributed to news on monday march   that japan had once again entered a recession this triggered a global sell off that disproportionately affected tech stocks

yahoo and ebay ending merge talks on march   exacerbated the fall

then further exacerbated by barron’s march   featured article titled “burning up warning internet companies are running out of cash — fast” this article is considered pivotal in the bust and an excellent piece of journalism that laid out the reality of the market and where things were headed i recommend reading it

then on april   microsoft is found guilty of monopolization and tying in violation of the sherman antitrust act which further exacerbated negativity

then the internet companies’ earnings started to roll out which  confirmed barron’s report

then a few months later the bankruptcies started

imagine like tech in  was  todays spacs  actual real companies the nasdaq was mostly composed of fraudulent companies no growth no revenues some didn’t even have products companies where  of their expenses went into exuberant marketing campaigns it was an ocean of wish nklas and clovs and then there were amazon microsoft and cisco lost like tears in rain",408,2022-02-22 23:08:05

not to be an ass but you kinda lose credibility when you are seriously incorrect from the basic structuring of google

googl is their class a shares goog is their class c

class a and class c should not have the same value on the market because of the fact their class a shares googl comes with x voting rights not their class c shares

this however is irrelevant as class b owns x the voting rights per share and is a majority ownership by page and brin in short not important

this is correct however but it doesnt change the fact that googl should come with a small premium and it usually does but for your average investor your x voting rights with  ownership in google wont matter so get the cheaper of the two


also their b class shares are not preferred stock its just another class of common shares thats structured to have x voting power

stocks,What value do I bring by buying stocks?,syx9nk,"well you certainly do not bring direct value to the business but you create liquidity and demand for the stock and very slightly contribute to its upward momentum

if demand is strong and the price is going up the company is in a good position to finance itself by issuing new stock on the market either directly or through banks that will guarantee the price of the issuance

the company that decides to use loans rather than dilute ownership will also be in a position to negotiate way better conditions if their stock is liquid and has a good value because they have the choice to issue shares so they have a plan b if they dont get favorable terms on the loan

some diseases are the low hanging fruit where the genetic mechanism is simple and well understood but such diseases are the minority the most valuable companies may thus be those that control the data and techniques to predict gene editing targets i know regeneron is pretty active in that field and other big pharma may be too",26,2022-02-19 13:16:55

that inevitably means some companies in this space will grow to become some of the biggest companies in the world x in this space is not out of the question

the only unknown is which companies and on which timeframe itll be here for sure in  years but when will it first start doing more than curing  or  previously incurable diseases and treating cancer like its doing today when will it be applicable on a scale where it makes money within  years seems pretty certain but it just as easily could do nothing for another
